# AGENTS.md

These instructions apply to the entire Photivra engine repository.

## Project identity

- Project: **Photivra**
- Pronunciation (IPA): /foʊˈtɪvɹə/
- Package: `@photivra/engine`
- License: Apache-2.0

Treat this repository as a complete, standalone open-source scientific/business-logic project. Do not add references or dependencies that require access to private repositories or private product code.


## Non-negotiable rules

1. Never introduce copied, restricted, or ambiguously licensed source code, data, calibration material, model weights, or protected expression.
2. Never fabricate scientific accuracy, calibration, uncertainty, confidence, or physical-performance claims.
3. Preserve backward compatibility of public APIs and schemas unless an explicit breaking change is approved.
4. Keep the root public package browser-safe and keep Node-only tooling out of the published package surface.
5. Never weaken CI, security, provenance, licensing, SPDX, identity, browser-surface, or package-surface gates to make a change pass.
6. Never commit secrets, credentials, private keys, private datasets, or restricted material.
7. Call out any new monetary cost before adopting a paid service, dependency, dataset, or infrastructure component.

## Repository map

- `src/` — scientific implementation, schemas, validation, and composed engine logic.
- `src/api/` — repository-only local Node transport; not a public package surface.
- `test/` — deterministic unit, regression, invariant, fuzz/property, parser, and integration tests.
- `docs/USAGE.md` — canonical public API examples.
- `docs/PROVENANCE.md` — scientific/source provenance rules.
- `docs/API_STYLE.md` — public API conventions.
- `scripts/` — CI, package-surface, license, identity, and browser-boundary gates.

## Sources of truth

- Scientific equations and behavior are defined by implementation plus tests; documentation must agree with them.
- Public API shape and semantics are defined by exported TypeScript contracts, tests, and `docs/API_STYLE.md`.
- If documentation, tests, and implementation disagree, do not guess. Determine the intended contract, fix the stale source, and add a regression test when behavior is involved.
- UI or downstream clients are never authoritative sources for camera science.

## Priorities

In descending order:

1. Scientific correctness and explicit assumptions.
2. Legal/source provenance and license cleanliness.
3. Security, privacy, and package-boundary integrity.
4. Backward compatibility of public APIs and schemas.
5. Deterministic tests and reproducibility.
6. Minimal, maintainable implementation.
7. Performance where measurements show material value.
8. Documentation that is complete, concise, and current.

Do not weaken an existing release, provenance, licensing, browser-surface, or package-surface gate to make a change pass.

## Scientific integrity

- Use explicit physical units in names and contracts.
- Keep equations, coordinate conventions, assumptions, and valid ranges documented.
- Prefer established analytical relations and independently derived tests.
- Never fabricate calibration values, uncertainty, confidence, error bars, or physical accuracy claims.
- Label results honestly as calculated, calibrated, estimated, or approximation.
- Keep independent physical effects separate unless a documented model justifies combining them.
- Do not claim performance for named commercial cameras, lenses, stabilization systems, or sensors without defensible licensed calibration data.
- Treat public standards, papers, patents, and web references as references, not permission to copy protected expression or data.

## Public API and compatibility

Backward compatibility matters.

- Preserve existing public exports, argument semantics, units, return shapes, error behavior, and schema meaning unless an explicit breaking change is approved.
- Prefer typed/config-object inputs for multi-parameter functions.
- Follow the conventions in `docs/API_STYLE.md`.
- Keep result/provenance structures consistent across modules.
- Do not silently reinterpret an existing field or unit.
- If behavior must change, add regression tests and document compatibility impact.

## Runtime and package boundary

- The root package must remain browser-safe and ESM-only.
- Node-only code must not become reachable from the root public export.
- The repository-local POC HTTP code under `src/api` is contributor tooling, not a supported package subpath or production architecture.
- Keep the published npm tarball limited to the intended root scientific surface.
- Do not add runtime dependencies without a concrete need, provenance/license review, and explicit approval.
- Reuse existing helpers/modules before adding parallel abstractions.

## Security and privacy

- Never commit credentials, API keys, tokens, private keys, secrets, private datasets, or restricted calibration material.
- Treat external JSON and other untrusted inputs as untrusted at runtime; TypeScript types are not validation.
- Keep the local POC server loopback-oriented and unauthenticated-development-only.
- Do not introduce persistence, telemetry, external network calls, uploads, accounts, remote code, or hosted-service dependencies without an explicit design/security review.
- Fail safely on malformed or non-finite scientific inputs.

## Legal, IP, and provenance

- Maintain Apache-2.0 and SPDX requirements.
- Follow `DCO`, `docs/PROVENANCE.md`, and `THIRD_PARTY.md`.
- Do not copy or adapt third-party code, prose, tables, diagrams, datasets, model weights, calibration files, waveform files, or protected technical expression without explicit compatible rights.
- Record third-party material and licenses when incorporated.
- Do not use third-party logos, trademarks, trade dress, or source-identifying branded designs except where a narrow factual/nominative reference is necessary and reviewed.
- AI-assisted work is draft material until substantively human-reviewed; an AI claim of originality or license compatibility is not provenance evidence.

## Testing and verification

For meaningful changes, run the smallest relevant tests first, then the full release checks before merge:

```sh
npm ci
npm run check
npm run coverage
npm run build
npm run pack:check
```

Requirements:

- Add deterministic tests for equations, invariants, parsing, edge cases, and regressions where they materially increase confidence.
- Preserve fixed seeds for fuzz/property tests.
- Do not reduce coverage thresholds to land a change.
- Keep browser-surface, dependency-license, SPDX, identity, and package-surface gates green.

## Documentation

Update documentation in the same change when public behavior, equations, assumptions, limitations, schemas, APIs, provenance, or release requirements change.

Documentation must:

- match actual code;
- distinguish exact calculations from approximations;
- use concise examples that compile against the public API;
- avoid marketing claims unsupported by the model;
- preserve the canonical Photivra identity and pronunciation.

## Change discipline

- Prefer the smallest change that fully solves the problem.
- Avoid unrelated refactors, formatting churn, dependency upgrades, and file movement.
- Preserve existing architecture unless there is evidence that changing it materially improves correctness, safety, maintainability, or performance.
- Investigate root causes rather than masking failing tests.
- Review the final diff for accidental API, security, licensing, or package-surface changes.
- Treat material scientific, security, licensing, provenance, trademark, package-boundary, and unsupported-claim findings as release blockers.

## Cost control

Cost is a project constraint.

Before introducing anything that may cost money—paid APIs, hosted services, storage, CDN features, SaaS, licensed datasets, commercial dependencies, or recurring infrastructure—explicitly call out:

- what would cost money;
- expected fixed and usage-based cost at realistic usage;
- a no-cost or lower-cost alternative when practical.

Do not commit the project to a paid service without explicit approval.

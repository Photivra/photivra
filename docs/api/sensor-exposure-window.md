# sensor/exposure-window.ts public contracts

The package and root API versions are recorded once in [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## calculateCaptureExposureWindows

Works out each point's local exposure window from separate opening and
closing boundary schedules.

Times are seconds from the first opening boundary. This is deliberately not
the camera-rotation API's global "exposure start"; a later layer must link the
two explicitly.

The mechanism records whether each boundary is mechanical or electronic, but
supplies no sweep duration or direction. Every timing value and direction for
a non-simultaneous boundary is declared by the caller, with evidence.

Only simultaneous boundaries and a uniform linear sweep along one native
sensor axis are supported. Not modelled: curtain acceleration, segmented or
non-linear electronic schedules, flash or flicker, rolling-shutter image
distortion, shutter shock, and EFCS (electronic first-curtain shutter)
effects on the pupil or bokeh.

```ts
export function calculateCaptureExposureWindows(
  input: CalculateCaptureExposureWindowsInput
): CalculationResult<CaptureExposureWindows>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## CalculateCaptureExposureWindowsInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface CalculateCaptureExposureWindowsInput {
  nativeRaster: NativeImageRaster;
  /**
   * Active capture rectangle, in fixed native pixel coordinates.
   *
   * Defaults to the whole native image. Sweep timing is never worked out by
   * scaling a full-frame timing value to this rectangle.
   */
  activeCaptureRect?: RasterRect;
  shutterMechanism: CaptureShutterMechanism;
  /**
   * Nominal time between the opening and closing reference points (phase zero).
   *
   * A point's local exposure can differ from this when the opening and closing
   * boundaries sweep differently across the sensor.
   */
  nominalExposureDurationSeconds: SourcedCaptureTimingSeconds;
  opening: ExposureBoundarySchedule;
  closing: ExposureBoundarySchedule;
  /**
   * Optional points, in continuous native pixel coordinates measured from pixel
   * edges, to report windows for. A pixel centre is at +0.5.
   */
  samplePointsNative?: readonly RasterPoint[];
}
```

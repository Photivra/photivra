# exposure/flash.ts public contracts

The package and root API versions are recorded once in [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](../DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## createHighSpeedSyncIlluminationOverlay

Registers a resolved HSS burst as a temporal illumination overlay (rectangular quasi-continuous
waveform over [0, D]); every line then integrates the burst over its own local exposure window.

```ts
export function createHighSpeedSyncIlluminationOverlay(
  input: Omit<CreateManualFlashIlluminationOverlayInput, "resolvedSync"> & { resolvedSync: ResolvedHighSpeedFlashSync }
): ManualFlashIlluminationOverlay;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## createManualFlashIlluminationOverlay

Construct an owned registered temporal illumination overlay from the resolved manual pulse while
preserving base ambient source identity.

Manual flash is a registered relative pulse/source overlay on the capture opening-reference clock.
Ordinary front/rear sync requires a real whole-frame opening interval. HSS/TTL and flash metering
are unsupported here; source magnitude, optical transport and sensor integration retain their own
contracts.

```ts
export function createManualFlashIlluminationOverlay(
  input:
    CreateManualFlashIlluminationOverlayInput
): ManualFlashIlluminationOverlay;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## resolveHighSpeedFlashSync

Resolves high-speed (focal-plane) sync as a pulsed quasi-continuous burst spanning the whole
travelling-slit exposure.

When the opening and closing boundaries traverse the frame so that no instant exposes the whole
frame (shutter faster than the ordinary sync limit), a single short pulse would expose only a band.
HSS instead emits a rapid pulse train that behaves as constant output P over the burst D from the
first line opening to the last line closing. Each line integrates P·t_e over its slit time t_e. If
the burst carries energy E_burst = η·p·E_pulse (η declared by the sync profile, p the power
fraction, E_pulse the ordinary full-power pulse energy), then P = E_burst/D and each line receives
η·p·E_pulse·t_e/D. Because exposure ∝ GN² (inverse-square law, GN = d·N), the effective guide number
relative to the same-power ordinary pulse is GN_HSS/GN = √(η·t_e/D). Shortening t_e by one stop
therefore costs half a stop of guide number. Approximation: the pulse train is treated as continuous
(pulse period ≪ t_e), recycle/thermal limits are folded into η, and front/rear-curtain placement does
not apply because the burst spans the whole exposure.

```ts
export function resolveHighSpeedFlashSync(input: ResolveHighSpeedFlashSyncInput): ResolvedHighSpeedFlashSync;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

  flashProfile: ManualFlashProfile;
  /** Schema 0.2.0 profile with highSpeedSyncSupported true. */
  syncCapabilities: FlashSyncCapabilityProfile;
  timing: ResolvedCaptureModeTiming;
  /** Commanded output as a fraction of full power, (0, 1]. */

## resolveManualFlashSync

Place a declared ordinary flash pulse into the actual whole-frame exposure opening interval for
front or rear sync, or return structured incompatibility.

Manual flash is a registered relative pulse/source overlay on the capture opening-reference clock.
Ordinary front/rear sync requires a real whole-frame opening interval. HSS/TTL and flash metering
are unsupported here; source magnitude, optical transport and sensor integration retain their own
contracts.

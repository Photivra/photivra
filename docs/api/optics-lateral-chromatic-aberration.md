# optics/lateral-chromatic-aberration.ts public contracts

The package and root API versions are recorded once in [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## calculateInverseLateralChromaticAberrationMapping

Inverse-maps one distorted output point separately for the representative
red, green and blue channels.

Renderers can sample the returned per-channel ideal source points directly,
without writing their own chromatic-aberration equations.

```ts
export function calculateInverseLateralChromaticAberrationMapping(
  input: CalculateInverseLateralChromaticAberrationMappingInput
): CalculationResult<InverseLateralChromaticAberrationMapping>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## CalculateInverseLateralChromaticAberrationMappingInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface CalculateInverseLateralChromaticAberrationMappingInput {
  /**
   * Distorted output image-plane point. Each channel is inverse-mapped on its
   * own to its ideal source point.
   */
  distortedImagePointMm: LensFieldPointMm;
  profile: LateralChromaticAberrationProfile;
}
```

## calculateInverseLateralChromaticAberrationMappings

Inverse-maps many distorted points at once. The shared CA profile is
resolved once, and each combined channel profile is validated once, for
the whole batch.

Each point's values match calculateInverseLateralChromaticAberrationMapping().
Provenance is reported once for the batch.

```ts
export function calculateInverseLateralChromaticAberrationMappings(
  input: CalculateInverseLateralChromaticAberrationMappingsInput
): CalculationResult<InverseLateralChromaticAberrationMappings>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## CalculateInverseLateralChromaticAberrationMappingsInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface CalculateInverseLateralChromaticAberrationMappingsInput {
  /**
   * Distorted output image-plane points. The profile is resolved once for the
   * batch. Then each point is inverse-mapped separately for red, green and
   * blue.
   */
  distortedImagePointsMm: readonly LensFieldPointMm[];
  profile: LateralChromaticAberrationProfile;
}
```

## calculateLateralChromaticAberrationMapping

Calculates how far lateral chromatic aberration (CA) separates the colour
channels at one ideal image-plane point. The point goes through a shared
base distortion (green is the reference) plus extra radial coefficients for
red and blue.

This moves each channel; it is not a blur kernel.

```ts
export function calculateLateralChromaticAberrationMapping(
  input: CalculateLateralChromaticAberrationMappingInput
): CalculationResult<LateralChromaticAberrationMapping>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface CalculateLateralChromaticAberrationMappingInput {
  /** Ideal/undistorted image-plane point shared by all channels. */
  imagePointMm: LensFieldPointMm;
  profile: LateralChromaticAberrationProfile;
}
```

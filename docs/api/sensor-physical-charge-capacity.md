# sensor/physical-charge-capacity.ts public contracts

The package and root API versions are recorded once in [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## assessSensorPhysicalChargeCapacity

Compares the complete expected stored electrons with the physical capacity that applies, and
reports the remaining headroom in expected electrons. Non-linear storage is not simulated.

It does not clip random realizations and does not model overflow or blooming.

```ts
export function assessSensorPhysicalChargeCapacity(
  input:
    AssessSensorPhysicalChargeCapacityInput
): CalculationResult<SensorPhysicalChargeCapacityAssessment>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## AssessSensorPhysicalChargeCapacityInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface AssessSensorPhysicalChargeCapacityInput {
  accumulatedCharge:
    SensorAccumulatedChargeComposition;
  capacityProfile:
    SensorPhysicalChargeCapacityProfile;
  operatingStateId: string;
  operatingTemperatureC: number;
}
```

## parseSensorPhysicalChargeCapacityProfile

Validates untrusted input and returns it as a normalized, typed value. Unknown enum values,
missing required fields and inconsistent scientific data are rejected.

The capacity is a total stored-electron limit from a specific source, tied to a site, operating
state and temperature. Camera saturation capacity and ADC or readout thresholds are separate.

```ts
export function parseSensorPhysicalChargeCapacityProfile(
  value: unknown
): SensorPhysicalChargeCapacityProfile;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

# optics/lens-psf-profile.ts public contracts

The package and root API versions are recorded once in [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](../DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## assessMtfOnlyPsfRenderability

Explain why MTF-only evidence cannot determine a unique renderable PSF; return blockers instead of
fabricating phase information.

Sampled lens PSF shapes bind exact generic optical state, field, wavelength and signed defocus
support. Interpolation stays within declared applicability and preserves normalized shape separately
from throughput. MTF-only data lacks phase/spatial information and does not authorize rendering a
unique PSF.

```ts
export function assessMtfOnlyPsfRenderability(
  profile:
    LensMtfDiagnosticProfile
): MtfOnlyPsfRenderabilityAssessment;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## LensSampledPsfInterpolation

Kernel interpolation between regular-grid nodes.
- `bounded-regular-grid-multilinear`: legacy weighted sum of kernel values. Blending kernels whose
  peaks sit at different positions produces multiple peaks.
- `bounded-regular-grid-centroid-aligned`: each node kernel is shifted so its intensity centroid
  sits at the weighted (interpolated) centroid before the same multilinear weights are applied,
  so shifted or asymmetric PSFs blend into one peak at the interpolated position.
- `rotationally-symmetric-radial-field-centroid-aligned`: for a rotationally symmetric lens, nodes
  are declared only along the +X field axis (fieldYmm = [0], fieldXmm >= 0); a query at field
  (x, y) is interpolated at radius hypot(x, y) with centroid alignment and the kernel is then
  rotated by atan2(y, x) about its centre (square sample pitch required).
Shifts and rotations use bilinear resampling, which slightly smooths the kernel (at most about
one sample); outside-kernel samples are zero and the result is renormalised to unit energy.

```ts
export type LensSampledPsfInterpolation =
  | "bounded-regular-grid-multilinear"
  | "bounded-regular-grid-centroid-aligned"
  | "rotationally-symmetric-radial-field-centroid-aligned";

## parseLensMtfDiagnosticProfile

Validate an untrusted declaration and return the normalized typed contract. Unknown enum values,
missing required fields and incompatible scientific data fail at this boundary.

Sampled lens PSF shapes bind exact generic optical state, field, wavelength and signed defocus
support. Interpolation stays within declared applicability and preserves normalized shape separately
from throughput. MTF-only data lacks phase/spatial information and does not authorize rendering a
unique PSF.

```ts
export function parseLensMtfDiagnosticProfile(
  value: unknown
): LensMtfDiagnosticProfile;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

# exposure/program-line.ts public contracts

The package and root API versions are recorded once in [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## EXPOSURE_PROGRAM_LINE_SCHEMA_VERSION

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
EXPOSURE_PROGRAM_LINE_SCHEMA_VERSION =
  "0.1.0" as const
```

## ExposureProgramLineNode

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface ExposureProgramLineNode {
  nodeId: string;
  opticalExposureStopsFromReference: number;
  aperture: number;
  shutterSeconds: number;
}
```

## ExposureProgramLineProfile

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface ExposureProgramLineProfile {
  schemaVersion:
    typeof EXPOSURE_PROGRAM_LINE_SCHEMA_VERSION;
  profileId: string;
  profileVersion: string;
  scientificStatus: "approximation";
  policyKind:
    "generic-program-line";
  interpolation:
    "log2-aperture-shutter";
  evidence: readonly EvidenceProvenance[];
  limitations: readonly string[];
  nodes:
    readonly ExposureProgramLineNode[];
}
```

## parseExposureProgramLineProfile

Parses a generic educational/product exposure program line.

A program line is control policy, not physics. Each node declares a wanted
aperture/shutter pair at an explicit number of stops of optical exposure,
relative to the resolver's reference exposure. The resolver later checks
that every node is physically consistent with that reference and with what
the equipment can do.

```ts
export function parseExposureProgramLineProfile(
  value: unknown
): ExposureProgramLineProfile;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

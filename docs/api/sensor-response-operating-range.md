# sensor/response-operating-range.ts public contracts

The package and root API versions are recorded once in [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## assessSensorResponseOperatingRange

Checks every declared spectral-bin input against the operating range and the superposition
requirement, before any instantaneous response conversion is allowed.

Each bin must be in range, and spatial linear superposition must hold. A valid average must not
hide a part of the aperture that is too bright.

```ts
export function assessSensorResponseOperatingRange(
  input:
    AssessSensorResponseOperatingRangeInput
): CalculationResult<SensorResponseOperatingRangeAssessment>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## AssessSensorResponseOperatingRangeInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface AssessSensorResponseOperatingRangeInput {
  reduction:
    SensorSpatioSpectralIrradianceReduction;
  compatibility:
    SensorResponseApplicationCompatibilityAssessment;
  operatingRangeProfile:
    SensorResponseOperatingRangeProfile;
}
```

## parseSensorResponseOperatingRangeProfile

Validates untrusted input and returns it as a normalized, typed value. Unknown enum values,
missing required fields and inconsistent scientific data are rejected.

The profile states the input quantity (incident power or irradiance), wavelength coverage,
reference conditions and non-linearity criterion of the calibrated operating range.

```ts
export function parseSensorResponseOperatingRangeProfile(
  value: unknown
): SensorResponseOperatingRangeProfile;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

```ts
export interface SensorResponseLinearityCriterion {
  maximumAbsoluteRelativeDeviation: number;

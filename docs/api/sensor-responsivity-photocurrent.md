# sensor/responsivity-photocurrent.ts public contracts

The package and root API versions are recorded once in [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## calculateSensorResponsivityPhotocurrent

Sums responsivity (A/W) × radiant power over wavelength bins to get the steady current magnitude,
under explicit electrical conditions.

This is not EQE, an electron rate, a transimpedance voltage or RAW. Fast-changing current needs a
separate time-dependent detector model.

```ts
export function calculateSensorResponsivityPhotocurrent(
  input:
    CalculateSensorResponsivityPhotocurrentInput
): CalculationResult<SensorResponsivityPhotocurrent>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## CalculateSensorResponsivityPhotocurrentInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface CalculateSensorResponsivityPhotocurrentInput {
  reduction:
    SensorSpatioSpectralIrradianceReduction;
  compatibility:
    SensorResponseApplicationCompatibilityAssessment;
  operatingRange:
    SensorResponseOperatingRangeAssessment;
  colorSamplingProfile:

  spectralResponseProfile:
    SensorSpectralResponseProfile;
  electricalApplicabilityProfile:
    SensorResponsivityElectricalApplicabilityProfile;
  operatingElectricalConditions:
    SensorResponsivityElectricalConditions;
}
```

## parseSensorResponsivityElectricalApplicabilityProfile

Validates untrusted input and returns it as a normalized, typed value. Unknown enum values,
missing required fields and inconsistent scientific data are rejected.

The profile states the electrical bias and load conditions under which an A/W responsivity applies.

```ts
export function parseSensorResponsivityElectricalApplicabilityProfile(
  value: unknown
): SensorResponsivityElectricalApplicabilityProfile;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

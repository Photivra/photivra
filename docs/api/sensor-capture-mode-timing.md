# sensor/capture-mode-timing.ts public contracts

The package and root API versions are recorded once in [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## CAPTURE_MODE_TIMING_PROFILE_SCHEMA_VERSION

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
CAPTURE_MODE_TIMING_PROFILE_SCHEMA_VERSION =
  "0.1.0" as const
```

## CaptureModeTimingProfile

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface CaptureModeTimingProfile {
  schemaVersion:
    typeof CAPTURE_MODE_TIMING_PROFILE_SCHEMA_VERSION;
  profileId: string;
  profileVersion: string;
  captureModeId: string;
  scientificStatus: "approximation";
  scheduleFamily:
    "global-or-uniform-linear-native-scan";
  shutterMechanism:
    CaptureShutterMechanism;
  opening:
    ExposureBoundarySchedule;
  closing:
    ExposureBoundarySchedule;
  readout:
    SensorReadoutTimingDeclaration;
  nonUniformScheduleModeled: false;
  evidence: readonly EvidenceProvenance[];
  limitations: readonly string[];
}
```

## parseCaptureModeTimingProfile

Parses timing facts tied to one exact capture mode.

Schema 0.1.0 accepts only the schedules the readout-timing and exposure-window
models already support: global (simultaneous) or uniform linear native scans.
Non-uniform or segmented schedules are rejected rather than approximated.

```ts
export function parseCaptureModeTimingProfile(
  value: unknown
): CaptureModeTimingProfile;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## resolveCaptureModeTiming

Resolves the exposure and readout timing for one exact capture mode and
timing profile.

Readout timing stays separate from the exposure opening and closing times.
No absolute sync between readout and exposure is assumed.

```ts
export function resolveCaptureModeTiming(
  input:
    ResolveCaptureModeTimingInput
): ResolvedCaptureModeTiming;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## ResolveCaptureModeTimingInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface ResolveCaptureModeTimingInput {
  captureMode:
    ResolvedCaptureMode;
  timingProfile:
    CaptureModeTimingProfile;
  nominalExposureDurationSeconds:
    SourcedCaptureTimingSeconds;
  activeCaptureRect?: RasterRect;
  samplePointsNative?:
    readonly RasterPoint[];
}
```

## ResolvedCaptureModeTiming

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface ResolvedCaptureModeTiming {
  schemaVersion:
    typeof CAPTURE_MODE_TIMING_PROFILE_SCHEMA_VERSION;
  timingProfileId: string;
  timingProfileVersion: string;
  captureModeId: string;
  captureModeTimingIdentity:
    "exact-mode-and-profile";
  nativeRaster: NativeImageRaster;
  modeDeclaresTimingDependency:
    boolean;
  scheduleFamily:
    "global-or-uniform-linear-native-scan";
  exposureWindows:
    CaptureExposureWindows;
  readoutTiming:
    SensorReadoutTiming;
  timeReference:
    "first-opening-boundary-phase";
  readoutExposureSynchronization:
    "not-assumed";
  nonUniformScheduleModeled: false;
  evidence: readonly EvidenceProvenance[];
  limitations: readonly string[];
}
```

# sensor/response-application-compatibility.ts public contracts

The package and root API versions are recorded once in [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## assessSensorResponseApplicationCompatibility

Checks whether the source plane, area, profile, channel and reference conditions allow the
selected way of applying the response.

Passing this alone does not allow converting light to signal. The per-bin operating-range check
and the EQE or A/W conversion are separate steps.

```ts
export function assessSensorResponseApplicationCompatibility(
  input:
    AssessSensorResponseApplicationCompatibilityInput
): CalculationResult<SensorResponseApplicationCompatibilityAssessment>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## AssessSensorResponseApplicationCompatibilityInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface AssessSensorResponseApplicationCompatibilityInput {
  reduction:
    SensorSpatioSpectralIrradianceReduction;
  applicationProfile:
    SensorResponseApplicationProfile;
  sourcePlane:
    SourcedSensorResponseSourcePlane;
  operatingConditions?:
    SensorSpectralReferenceConditions;
}
```

## parseSensorResponseApplicationProfile

Validates untrusted input and returns it as a normalized, typed value. Unknown enum values,
missing required fields and inconsistent scientific data are rejected.

The profile states the source plane, incident-area basis, spatial uniformity and reference
conditions under which a response applies.

```ts
export function parseSensorResponseApplicationProfile(
  value: unknown
): SensorResponseApplicationProfile;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

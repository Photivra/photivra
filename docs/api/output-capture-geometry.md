# output/capture-geometry.ts public contracts

Package **1.4.0**, root API **1.4.0**. [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](../DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## ActiveCaptureFieldOfView

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface ActiveCaptureFieldOfView {
  orientation: CaptureOrientation;
  horizontalDegrees: number;
  verticalDegrees: number;
  /**
   * Larger of the two opposite-corner diagonal angular spans. For centered
   * crops both diagonal spans are equal.
   */
  diagonalDegrees: number;
  horizontalBoundsDegrees: {
    minimum: number;
    maximum: number;
  };
  verticalBoundsDegrees: {
    minimum: number;
    maximum: number;
  };

```

## calculateActiveCaptureFieldOfView

Calculates asymmetric horizontal/vertical FOV plus opposite-corner diagonal
spans for the active physical capture area after physical camera orientation.

Final digital/output crop is intentionally excluded.

```ts
export function calculateActiveCaptureFieldOfView(
  input: CalculateActiveCaptureFieldOfViewInput
): CalculationResult<ActiveCaptureFieldOfView>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## CalculateActiveCaptureFieldOfViewInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface CalculateActiveCaptureFieldOfViewInput {
  imagingArea: SensorImagingArea;
  nativeRaster: NativeImageRaster;
  orientation: CaptureOrientation;
  activeCaptureRect?: RasterRect;
  focalLengthMm: number;
  focusDistanceM?: number;
}
```

## calculateOutputFieldOfView

Calculates final visible field of view after physical active capture,
orientation, and digital/output crop. Output raster resolution does not
affect this optical/framing result.

```ts
export function calculateOutputFieldOfView(
  input: CalculateOutputFieldOfViewInput
): CalculationResult<OutputFieldOfView>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## CalculateOutputFieldOfViewInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface CalculateOutputFieldOfViewInput {
  imagingArea: SensorImagingArea;
  nativeRaster: NativeImageRaster;
  orientation: CaptureOrientation;
  activeCaptureRect?: RasterRect;
  outputCropRect?: RasterRect;
  focalLengthMm: number;
  focusDistanceM?: number;
}
```

## CaptureOrientation

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export type CaptureOrientation =
  | "landscape"
  | "portrait-clockwise"
  | "landscape-inverted"
  | "portrait-counter-clockwise";
```

## ImagePlaneMetricPointMm

Pre-orientation optical image-plane coordinate in millimetres.

Origin is the optical axis; +X points right and +Y points up.

```ts
export interface ImagePlaneMetricPointMm {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}
```

## mapImagePlanePointToOrientedPhysicalUv

Maps a pre-orientation optical image-plane point into normalized coordinates
of an oriented physical raster region.

This is the exact coordinate inverse of
mapOrientedPhysicalUvToImagePlanePoint(). Points outside the supplied region
fail closed; a tiny tolerance only absorbs floating-point round-trip noise at
an edge.

```ts
export function mapImagePlanePointToOrientedPhysicalUv(
  input: MapImagePlanePointToOrientedPhysicalUvInput
): NormalizedRasterUv;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## MapImagePlanePointToOrientedPhysicalUvInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface MapImagePlanePointToOrientedPhysicalUvInput {
  imagePlanePointMm: ImagePlaneMetricPointMm;
  /**
   * Physical region represented by the normalized raster, after physical
   * camera orientation, using the capture contract's +Y-down physical basis.
   */
  orientedPhysicalBoundsFromOpticalAxisMm: PhysicalBoundsFromOpticalAxisMm;
  orientation: CaptureOrientation;
}
```

## MapOrientedPhysicalUvToImagePlaneInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface MapOrientedPhysicalUvToImagePlaneInput {
  uv: NormalizedRasterUv;
  /**
   * Physical region represented by the normalized raster, after physical
   * camera orientation, using the capture contract's +Y-down physical basis.
   */
  orientedPhysicalBoundsFromOpticalAxisMm: PhysicalBoundsFromOpticalAxisMm;
  orientation: CaptureOrientation;
}
```

## mapOrientedPhysicalUvToImagePlanePoint

Maps normalized coordinates in an oriented physical raster region into the
pre-orientation optical image plane used by lens-field and camera-mapping
APIs.

The supplied physical bounds use the capture contract's +Y-down basis after
physical camera orientation. The returned image-plane point uses optical-axis
origin, +X right and +Y up. No lens or projection equation is applied.

```ts
export function mapOrientedPhysicalUvToImagePlanePoint(
  input: MapOrientedPhysicalUvToImagePlaneInput
): ImagePlaneMetricPointMm;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## NormalizedRasterUv

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

  v: number;
}
```

```ts
export interface RasterPoint {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}
```

Integer half-open rectangle in raster coordinates.

Coordinates use a top-left origin with +X to the right and +Y downward.
The covered extent is [x, x + width) × [y, y + height).

and final digital/output geometry without conflating their identities.

```

   */
  activeCaptureRect?: RasterRect;
  /**
   * Final digital/output crop in oriented active-capture raster coordinates.
   *
   * Defaults to the full oriented active capture.
   */
  outputCropRect?: RasterRect;
  /**
   * Final output raster after optional digital crop/resampling.
   *
   * Defaults to the output-crop dimensions. The output raster must preserve
   * the crop aspect ratio within a small integer-rounding tolerance.
   */
  outputRaster?: RasterDimensions;
}
```

     * This crop does not mutate physical sensor identity or active-capture
     * geometry.
     */
    cropRect: RasterRect;

    /** Physical region retained by the digital/output crop. */
    imagingArea: SensorImagingArea;
    physicalBoundsFromOpticalAxisMm: PhysicalBoundsFromOpticalAxisMm;
    centerOffsetFromOpticalAxisMm: RasterVector;
    sourceRetainedAreaFraction: number;

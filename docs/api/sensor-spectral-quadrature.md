# sensor/spectral-quadrature.ts public contracts

The package and root API versions are recorded once in [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## calculateSensorSpectralQuadrature

Builds deterministic wavelength sample points for one exact sensor response
channel. It does not apply the response to any spectrum.

The requested range must lie fully inside the channel's declared usable
range. The response curve's breakpoints, plus any caller-supplied breakpoints
from the source spectrum or optics, split that range into segments. Each
segment is then subdivided so no midpoint subinterval is wider than
maximumSubintervalWidthNanometers.

wavelengthMeasureNanometers is dλ in nanometres, not a dimensionless response
weight. Multiply it only by a spectral density per nanometre, or convert
units explicitly first.

QE and A/W responsivity are deliberately not applied. They lead to different
signals: QE is photon-to-electron efficiency, while A/W responsivity relates
incident radiant power to electrical current. A later step must also match
responseScope to the source plane and collection area before integrating any
signal.

```ts
export function calculateSensorSpectralQuadrature(
  input:
    CalculateSensorSpectralQuadratureInput
): CalculationResult<SensorSpectralQuadrature>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

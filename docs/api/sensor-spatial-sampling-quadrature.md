# sensor/spatial-sampling-quadrature.ts public contracts

The package and root API versions are recorded once in [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## calculateSensorSpatialSamplingQuadrature

Builds the deterministic spatial sample points (quadrature nodes) for one CFA
(colour filter array) site.

It combines:

1. the site's geometric light-sensitive aperture (from sampling-aperture); and
2. the anti-aliasing (AA) point-splitting kernel (from optical-stack).

The aperture is integrated with a grid of evenly spaced midpoints (a
tensor-product midpoint rule). If an AA component moves light by +delta on
the sensor, a destination point samples the light field before AA at
destination − delta. Working backwards like this means the shift is never
applied twice.

The destination site's CFA channel applies to every node. The pre-AA source
point is a position in the light field, not another CFA site, so a shifted
source point never changes the destination channel.

Nodes whose pre-AA source point falls outside the active imaging area are
kept. They are neither clamped nor dropped (and weights are not
renormalized). The renderer or light-field provider decides how to cover them.

Normalized weights approximate a spatial average. Square-micrometre measures
approximate a geometric area integral. Neither includes throughput, QE,
photon conversion, microlenses, diffusion, crosstalk or integration over time.

```ts
export function calculateSensorSpatialSamplingQuadrature(
  input: CalculateSensorSpatialSamplingQuadratureInput
): CalculationResult<SensorSpatialSamplingQuadrature>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

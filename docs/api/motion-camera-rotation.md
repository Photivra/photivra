# motion/camera-rotation.ts public contracts

The package and root API versions are recorded once in [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## AxisSamplingPitchMicrometers

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface AxisSamplingPitchMicrometers {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}
```

## calculateCameraRotationImageMapping

Maps one stationary-world ray to its image-plane location after pure camera
rotation at an arbitrary physical time from exposure start.

The starting image point defines the world ray in the camera frame at t=0.
Constant angular velocity is integrated as a single axis-angle rotation
vector, which avoids any dependence on Euler-angle order. The world ray is
then expressed in the rotated camera frame with the inverse camera rotation,
and projected rectilinearly back onto the image plane.

Only rotation is modelled. Camera translation is deliberately left out,
because the image motion it causes depends on scene depth.

```ts
export function calculateCameraRotationImageMapping(
  input: CalculateCameraRotationImageMappingInput
): CalculationResult<CameraRotationImageMapping>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## CalculateCameraRotationImageMappingInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface CalculateCameraRotationImageMappingInput {
  /** Physical focal length in millimetres. */
  focalLengthMm: number;
  /**
   * Stationary-world-ray image-plane position at exposure start.
   *
   * Image-plane coordinates have their origin on the optical axis, +X right, +Y up.
   */
  imagePointMm: ImagePlanePointMm;
  /**
   * Time in seconds from exposure start. Must be greater than or equal to zero.
   */
  timeSecondsFromExposureStart: number;
  /**
   * Constant camera angular-velocity vector in radians per second.
   *
   * Components are given in the camera axes at exposure start and follow the
   * physical right-hand rule:
   * - pitch about +X: positive tilts up; content moves toward image -Y;
   * - yaw about +Y: positive turns left; content moves toward image +X;
   * - roll about +Z: positive is clockwise seen from behind the camera.
   * See CameraAngularVelocityRadPerSec.
   */
  angularVelocityRadPerSec: CameraAngularVelocityRadPerSec;
  /** Optional focus distance in metres for thin-lens projection distance. */
  focusDistanceM?: number;
  /**
   * Optional sampling pitch per axis, used to also report the displacement in
   * samples. This is the geometric spacing of samples, not the light-collecting
   * area of a photosite.
   */
  samplingPitchMicrometers?: AxisSamplingPitchMicrometers;
}
```

## calculateInverseCameraRotationImageMapping

Maps a captured stationary-world ray at one non-negative capture time back
to its image-plane location at exposure start.

For this constant-axis, pure-rotation model the inverse is analytic: apply
the forward camera rotation to the captured ray, then project
rectilinearly. No iterative solver is needed.

```ts
export function calculateInverseCameraRotationImageMapping(
  input: CalculateInverseCameraRotationImageMappingInput
): CalculationResult<InverseCameraRotationImageMapping>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## CalculateInverseCameraRotationImageMappingInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface CalculateInverseCameraRotationImageMappingInput {
  /** Physical focal length in millimetres. */
  focalLengthMm: number;
  /**
   * Captured image-plane location of a stationary world ray at the requested
   * time. Coordinates have their origin on the optical axis, +X right, +Y up.
   */
  imagePointMm: ImagePlanePointMm;
  /**
   * Capture time in seconds from exposure start. Must be greater than or equal
   * to zero.
   */
  timeSecondsFromExposureStart: number;
  /**
   * Constant camera angular-velocity vector in radians per second, with the
   * same sign/axis semantics as calculateCameraRotationImageMapping().
   */
  angularVelocityRadPerSec: CameraAngularVelocityRadPerSec;
  /** Optional focus distance in metres for thin-lens projection distance. */
  focusDistanceM?: number;
  /**
   * Optional sampling pitch per axis, used to also report the inverse
   * displacement in samples.
   */
  samplingPitchMicrometers?: AxisSamplingPitchMicrometers;
}
```

## CameraAngularVelocityRadPerSec

Camera angular velocity in radians per second about the exposure-start
camera axes (+X right, +Y up, +Z forward along the optical axis).

Signs follow the physical right-hand rule about each named axis. These axes
form a left-handed basis. So a positive rotation is the mirror image of what
the plain component Rodrigues (cross-product) formula would give in it:

- Positive pitch tilts the optical axis up. Still scene content moves
  toward image -Y (down).
- Positive yaw turns the optical axis left (counter-clockwise seen from
  above). Still scene content moves toward image +X (right).
- Positive roll turns the camera clockwise, as seen by the photographer
  looking along +Z. Still scene content rotates counter-clockwise in the
  +X-right/+Y-up image plane.

```ts
export interface CameraAngularVelocityRadPerSec {
  /** Right-hand rotation rate about camera +X (right): positive tilts the optical axis up. */
  pitch: number;
  /** Right-hand rotation rate about camera +Y (up): positive turns the optical axis left. */
  yaw: number;
  /** Right-hand rotation rate about camera +Z (forward): positive rolls the camera clockwise as seen from behind it. */
  roll: number;
}
```

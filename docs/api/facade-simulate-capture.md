# facade/simulate-capture.ts public contracts

The package and root API versions are recorded once in [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## DisplayViewResult

Result of {@link simulateDisplayView }: the full-resolution capture resized for display, estimated; not a capture.

## IdealReferenceResult

Result of {@link simulateIdealReference}: an ideal reference image, not a capture (no RAW, plan or request).

```ts
export interface IdealReferenceResult {
  kind: "ideal-reference";
  /** Human-readable label for a user interface. */
  label: string;

```

## serializeSimulatedCaptureDngFromParts

Writes the whole-frame DNG of `options` (`output.format: "dng"`, no `output.region`) from the packed RAW of region renders of
the same request (#391), so the RAW can render in parallel. A region render's native sites are the same sites as the whole
render's (each site's seeds come from its index in the whole raster), so the joined RAW is the whole render's RAW, and the
request is resolved and written exactly as `simulateCapture` writes its DNG: the bytes are the same. The parts must cover
every native site of the frame; where they overlap (each region carries the demosaic margin) their sites must agree. Region
renders of the request with any format serve (a region's own `output.format` does not change its RAW). A region cannot take
`output.whiteBalance: "auto"` or `output.dng`: render the parts with a fixed white balance (the RAW codes do not depend on the
white-balance intent) and pass the DNG's own options here, where auto white balance is measured over the joined frame.

```ts
export async function serializeSimulatedCaptureDngFromParts(options: SimulateCaptureOptions, parts: readonly SimulateCaptureDngPart[]): Promise<NativeRawDng>;
```

This call is asynchronous; byte hashing uses the caller runtime's Web Crypto.

## SIMULATE_CAPTURE_BOX_APERTURE_DEFAULT_SAMPLES

Default midpoint samples per axis of `sensor.pixelAperture: "box"`.

```ts
SIMULATE_CAPTURE_BOX_APERTURE_DEFAULT_SAMPLES = 4
```

## SIMULATE_CAPTURE_COST_OPTIONS

Options reported in `diagnostics.options` (2.1), in this order, when they ran: the ones that change how much work
a capture does. `motion.rotation` is a non-zero angular velocity; `sensor.temporalSampleCount` a count above 1.

```ts
SIMULATE_CAPTURE_COST_OPTIONS = Object.freeze(["lens.pupilSampling", "lens.projection", "lens.distortion", "lens.vignetting", "lens.psf",
  "lens.diffraction", "lens.defocus", "sensor.antiAliasing", "sensor.pixelAperture.box", "sensor.temporalSampleCount", "motion.rotation", "motion.shutter.rolling", "output.borderHandling.mirror", "output.region",
  "output.whiteBalance.auto", "output.demosaic.ahd", "output.highlightMode.reconstruct", "output.colorEncoding.wide-gamut", "output.gamutMapping.perceptual",
  "output.format.jpeg", "output.format.png", "output.format.dng"] as const)
```

## SIMULATE_CAPTURE_DEFAULT_ILLUMINANCE_LUX

Default illuminance, lux: an 18 % Lambertian grey card (L = 0.18·E/π) then gets exactly the CIPA DC-004 standard
output sensitivity reference exposure H = 10/S at f/8, 1/125 s, ISO 100:
E = π·10·N²/(0.65·t·S·0.18) = π·80 000/11.7 ≈ 21 480.98 lux.

```ts
SIMULATE_CAPTURE_DEFAULT_ILLUMINANCE_LUX = Math.PI * sosReferenceLuminance(DEFAULTS.fNumber, DEFAULTS.shutterSeconds, DEFAULTS.iso) /
  GREY_CARD_REFLECTANCE
```

## SIMULATE_CAPTURE_FACADE_VERSION

Version of how the facade builds requests. It changes whenever the same input would build a different request.

```ts
SIMULATE_CAPTURE_FACADE_VERSION = "1.0.0" as const
```

## SIMULATE_CAPTURE_FAST_OPTIONS

The options that take the exact-or-fast flag (#395), in the path style of {@link SIMULATE_CAPTURE_COST_OPTIONS}: each accepts
the record form with `fast` and is reported in `diagnostics.fast.applied` when it runs. Every one of them takes the flag,
whether or not it has a fast method yet; one without runs exact and reports `false`.

```ts
SIMULATE_CAPTURE_FAST_OPTIONS = Object.freeze(["lens.diffraction", "sensor.antiAliasing", "sensor.pixelAperture.box", "output.demosaic.ahd"] as const)
```

## SIMULATE_DISPLAY_VIEW_DEFAULT_SAMPLES_PER_AXIS

Default stratified samples per axis of a display view (`view.samplesPerAxis`): 16 × 16 sampled real pixels per display pixel with detail, 4 × 4 where it is uniform.

```ts
SIMULATE_DISPLAY_VIEW_DEFAULT_SAMPLES_PER_AXIS = 16
```

## simulateCapture

Simulates one still capture of a planar scene and returns the developed image, the packed RAW, the full
underlying request/plan, provenance and every assumption made. See docs/QUICK_START.md.

```ts
export async function simulateCapture(options: SimulateCaptureOptions): Promise<SimulateCaptureResult>;
```

This call is asynchronous; byte hashing uses the caller runtime's Web Crypto.

## SimulateCaptureAssumption

One decision the facade made: a default, a derived value or a fixed modelling choice.

```ts
export interface SimulateCaptureAssumption {
  /** Dotted option path or modelling topic, for example "exposure.shutterSeconds" or "model.lens-psf". */
  id: string;
  kind: "default" | "derived" | "model";
  value: unknown;
  explanation: string;
}
```

## SimulateCaptureAutoIsoAfterMaximum

#516: what aperture priority does with Auto ISO once the ISO reaches the body's Auto ISO maximum and the exposure is
still under the meter target: `"allow-slower-shutter"` lengthens the shutter past the slowest preferred shutter to reach
the target; `"hold-preferred-shutter"` keeps the preferred shutter and leaves the exposure under target.

```ts
export type SimulateCaptureAutoIsoAfterMaximum = "allow-slower-shutter" | "hold-preferred-shutter";
```

## SimulateCaptureAutoIsoReport

#516: how Auto ISO chose the ISO (`exposure.iso: "auto"`), reported in the result's `exposure.autoIso`. The full
resolver output stays in the capture's `exposure.resolution`.

```ts
export interface SimulateCaptureAutoIsoReport {
  /** The ISO the meter target asked for at the resolved aperture and shutter, before the Auto ISO range and the ISO grid. */
  idealIsoBeforeConstraints: number;
  /**
   * The body's Auto ISO range: its Auto ISO bounds, or its ISO range when it declares none (the tiers: ISO 100 to their
   * maximum). Without `limits` the ISO was chosen in this range.
   */
  autoIsoMinimum: number;
  autoIsoMaximum: number;
  /**
   * #505: present only with `exposure.autoIso.limits`: the photographer's Auto ISO range the ISO was chosen in, inside the
   * body's (`minimum` is the body's Auto ISO minimum when the option omits it).
   */
  limits?: { minimum: number; maximum: number };
  /** Whether the ISO was held at an end of the Auto ISO range. */
  clamped: false | "minimum" | "maximum";
  /**
   * The constraint that limited the resolved exposure: the resolver's `targetResidual.limitingConstraint`, for example
   * `"iso-maximum"` (the exposure stays under target at the body's Auto ISO maximum), `"user-iso-maximum"` (#505: at the
   * photographer's `limits.maximum`, below the body's), `"iso-grid-quantization"` (the nearest selectable ISO) or `"none"`
   * (on target).
   */
  limitingConstraint: ExposureResolutionConstraint;
  /** The resolver's residual, log2(target / achieved exposure), in stops: positive when the exposure is under the meter target, negative when over it. */
  residualStops: number;
  /**
   * Aperture priority, and program with a slowest preferred shutter (#504): the policy and slowest preferred shutter used,
   * and whether the slower-shutter fallback ran.
   */
  afterMaximumIso?: SimulateCaptureAutoIsoAfterMaximum;
  slowestPreferredShutterSeconds?: number;
  afterMaximumIsoFallbackUsed?: boolean;
  /** #504, program only: whether the program line's shutter was longer than the slowest preferred shutter and was held. */
  slowestPreferredShutterApplied?: boolean;
  /** #504: present only with `slowestPreferredShutterSeconds: "auto"`: how the engine derived it (`estimateAutoIsoSlowestShutter`). */
  automaticSlowestShutter?: SimulateCaptureAutomaticSlowestShutterReport;
}
```

## SimulateCaptureAutomaticSlowestShutterOptions

#504: the settings of `exposure.autoIso.slowestPreferredShutterSeconds: "auto"`. Every field is optional; the defaults are
labelled generic values, recorded as `default` assumptions.

```ts
export interface SimulateCaptureAutomaticSlowestShutterOptions {
  /** The bias in whole stops, as cameras' Auto minimum-shutter settings offer: +1 one stop faster, −1 one stop slower; −2 to +2. Default 0. */
  fasterByStops?: number;
  /** The shake blur allowed, in sensor pixels of `sensor.pixelPitchMicrometers`. Default 1 (a generic pixel-level budget). */
  blurBudgetPixels?: number;
  /**
   * The hand's constant angular velocity, rad/s (signs as in `motion.angularVelocityRadPerSec`; only the magnitude matters).
   * Default `GENERIC_HANDHELD_ANGULAR_VELOCITY_RAD_PER_SEC`: 4.39 °/s on yaw, a cited generic value for a 100 g phone held in
   * two hands (Xiao et al., Proc. SPIE 7250, 2009), not a measurement of you or of this camera.
   */
  angularVelocityRadPerSec?: { yaw: number; pitch: number };
  /** Stabilization in equivalent stops (≥ 0, at most 10), scaling the motion by 2^−stops. Default 0: the tiers declare no stabilization. */
  stabilizationStopsEquivalent?: number;
}
```

## SimulateCaptureAutomaticSlowestShutterReport

#504: the automatic slowest preferred shutter in the Auto ISO report.

```ts
export interface SimulateCaptureAutomaticSlowestShutterReport {
  /** The exposure time whose camera-shake blur equals the budget (`estimateCameraShakeBlur`), before the bias and the grid. */
  derivedShutterSeconds: number;
  fasterByStops: number;
  /** derivedShutterSeconds · 2^−fasterByStops. */
  biasedShutterSeconds: number;
  /** The slowest preferred shutter used: the biased time within the body's shutter range. */
  shutterSeconds: number;
  blurBudgetPixels: number;
  /** The shake blur at `shutterSeconds`, in pixels. */
  blurAtShutterPixels: number;
  angularVelocityRadPerSec: { yaw: number; pitch: number };
  stabilizationStopsEquivalent: number;
}
```

## SimulateCaptureBorderHandling

`margin` renders extra native sites around the output, as far as the kernel reaches. `mirror` renders
exactly the output and reads mirrored (reflect-101) copies of the missing border sites. Mirroring is
checked to keep the CFA (colour filter array) pattern consistent.

```ts
export type SimulateCaptureBorderHandling = "margin" | "mirror";
```

## SimulateCaptureColorEncoding

PNG colour encoding. `srgb` is the developed sRGB output. The others take the developed linear
colour (camera → XYZ → linear sRGB/D65, unclipped) and convert it through CIE XYZ into the target
primaries:
- `display-p3`: Display P3 primaries (W3C CSS Color 4 `display-p3`; also SMPTE EG 432-1) with the
  sRGB transfer function;
- `rec2020`: ITU-R BT.2020 primaries and OETF.
PQ and HLG (BT.2100) are not part of 2.0; see THIRD_PARTY.md.

```ts
export type SimulateCaptureColorEncoding = "srgb" | "display-p3" | "rec2020";
```

## SimulateCaptureCostOption

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export type SimulateCaptureCostOption = typeof SIMULATE_CAPTURE_COST_OPTIONS[number];
```

## SimulateCaptureDemosaic

Demosaic. `bilinear`: the built-in Bayer kernels (`createBuiltInBayerDemosaicProfiles`). `ahd` (2.1): adaptive
homogeneity-directed demosaicing (`createAhdDemosaicTask`, after Hirakawa & Parks 2005), a non-linear
edge-directed method that reduces zipper and false colour on sharp edges.

```ts
export type SimulateCaptureDemosaic = "bilinear" | "ahd";
```

## SimulateCaptureDemosaicRecord

`output.demosaic` as a record (#395): the demosaic and its `fast` override (see {@link SimulateCaptureOptions.fast}).

```ts
export interface SimulateCaptureDemosaicRecord { kind: SimulateCaptureDemosaic; fast?: boolean }
```

## SimulateCaptureDngPart

One part of a whole-frame DNG (#391): a region render's packed RAW and where its native sites lie (`result.raw`, `result.region`).

```ts
export interface SimulateCaptureDngPart {
  raw: Pick<NativeRawOutput, "codes" | "blackLevels" | "digitalSaturationCodes" | "saturationFlags" | "effectiveSaturationCodes">;
  region: { nativeRect: { x: number; y: number; width: number; height: number } };
}
```

export type SimulateCaptureExposureMode = "manual" | "aperture-priority" | "shutter-priority" | "program";
```

## SimulateCaptureFastOption

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export type SimulateCaptureFastOption = typeof SIMULATE_CAPTURE_FAST_OPTIONS[number];
```

## SimulateCaptureFastReport

`diagnostics.fast` of a capture or display view (#395): what was asked for and what ran.

```ts
export interface SimulateCaptureFastReport {
  /** True when `fast: true` was given at the top level or in any option's record. */
  requested: boolean;
  /** Each fast-capable option that ran, in {@link SIMULATE_CAPTURE_FAST_OPTIONS} order: true where its fast method ran. */
  applied: Readonly<Partial<Record<SimulateCaptureFastOption, boolean>>>;
  /** `engine-reference` when every option ran exact; `approximation-with-a-priori-bound` when any fast method ran (the WebGPU execution record's values). */
  assurance: "engine-reference" | "approximation-with-a-priori-bound";
}
```

## SimulateCaptureLensDistortion

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export type SimulateCaptureLensDistortion =
  | { kind: "radial"; profile: RadialDistortionProfile }
  | { kind: "brown-conrady"; profile: BrownConradyDistortionProfile };
```

## SimulateCaptureMotion

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface SimulateCaptureMotion {
  /** Constant camera angular velocity, rad/s, in the engine's pitch/yaw/roll convention. Missing axes are 0. */
  angularVelocityRadPerSec?: { pitch?: number; yaw?: number; roll?: number };
  /** Default "global". `rolling` derives the exposure schedule from the body's rolling readout declaration. */
  shutter?: "global" | "rolling";
  /** Rolling shutter only: time from the first to the last line over the simulated frame, in s. Default: the body's declared readout skew. */
  rollingShutterSkewSeconds?: number;
}
```

## SimulateCaptureOptions

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface SimulateCaptureOptions {
  /** Generic tier preset id or a full preset record (for example a modified copy of a catalog entry). Default "professional". */

     * factor of the simulated frame (output width × height × pixel pitch); it replaces the tier lens's focal length and
     * f-number range (the tier lens's transmission is kept). An f-number outside the prime's range, or a subject or

## SimulateCaptureSensorAntiAliasing

Optical anti-aliasing (low-pass) filter (2.1), modelled as birefringent point splitting: each image point is
split into equally bright copies (the engine's `normalized-point-splitting-kernel` optical-stack response).
- `four-spot`: two crossed birefringent plates; copies at (±d/2, ±d/2), weight 1/4 each, MTF |cos(π·f_x·d)·cos(π·f_y·d)|.
- `two-spot`: one plate splitting along `axis`; copies at ±d/2, weight 1/2 each, MTF |cos(π·f·d)|.
- `point-splitting`: the engine contract itself, offsets in micrometres (+x right, +y down) and positive weights
  summing to 1 (at most 16 components, each within 4 sites).
d = `separationSites` × pixel pitch, 0 < separationSites ≤ 4, default 1 (first MTF zero at the sensor's Nyquist
frequency 1/(2·pitch)).

```ts
export type SimulateCaptureSensorAntiAliasing =
  | { kind: "four-spot"; separationSites?: number; fast?: boolean }
  | { kind: "two-spot"; axis: "horizontal" | "vertical"; separationSites?: number; fast?: boolean }
  | { kind: "point-splitting"; components: readonly AntiAliasingPointSplitComponent[]; fast?: boolean };
```

## SimulateCaptureWhiteBalance

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export type SimulateCaptureWhiteBalance =
  | "scene-illuminant"
  | "auto"
  | "none"
  | { kelvin: number; tint?: number }
  | { channelGains: { red: number; green: number; blue: number } };
```

## SimulateDisplayViewOptions

The display size and sampling of {@link simulateDisplayView }.

```ts
export interface SimulateDisplayViewOptions {
  /** Display pixels, 1 to the capture's output width and height. */
  width: number;
  height: number;
  /** Stratified Monte Carlo samples per axis for each display pixel's expected value (1–32, default 8: 64 real pixels). */
  samplesPerAxis?: number;
  /** "srgb-8" (default) or "srgb-16". */
  format?: "srgb-8" | "srgb-16";
  /** Render only this rectangle of the display view, in display pixels; byte-identical to the same pixels of the whole view. */
  region?: { x: number; y: number; width: number; height: number };
}
```

## simulateIdealReference

The ideal reference of a capture request (2.3): the same scene, framing, chart size, output size, region and pixel
grid as `simulateCapture(options)` would use, rendered with no camera effects (no lens blur, diffraction, defocus,
distortion, vignetting, anti-aliasing filter, mosaic or demosaic, noise, dark signal or motion), at the capture's
own exposure and developed with its white balance, colour matrices, tone curve and encoding (the
`reference.exposure` assumption). Deterministic and cheap: no RAW is simulated. Formats srgb-8, srgb-16 and png.
The result is labelled `kind: "ideal-reference"`; it is not a capture.

```ts
export async function simulateIdealReference(options: SimulateCaptureOptions): Promise<IdealReferenceResult>;
```

This call is asynchronous; byte hashing uses the caller runtime's Web Crypto.

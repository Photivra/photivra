# core/image-formation.ts public contracts

Package **1.5.0**, root API **1.5.0**. [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](../DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## getImageFormationContract

Returns the public image-formation ownership/order contract.

The result is descriptive metadata, not a renderer implementation or an
assertion that every reserved stage is currently available.

```ts
export function getImageFormationContract(): ImageFormationContract;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## IMAGE_FORMATION_CONTRACT_VERSION

Version of the public image-formation ordering contract.

This version is independent from package, root-engine, and composed-POC
versions. It describes semantic ownership/order only; it does not imply that
every reserved stage is implemented.

```ts
IMAGE_FORMATION_CONTRACT_VERSION = "0.4.0" as const
```

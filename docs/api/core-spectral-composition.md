# core/spectral-composition.ts public contracts

The package and root API versions are recorded once in [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## composeSpectralCoverage

Finds the wavelength range that all continuous inputs share, and collects every
interpolation breakpoint inside it.

Air and vacuum wavelengths are never converted implicitly. Discrete lines are not
accepted here: a delta-like line is integrated differently from a continuous
per-nanometre density.

```ts
export function composeSpectralCoverage(
  input: ComposeSpectralCoverageInput
): SpectralCoverageComposition;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## ComposeSpectralCoverageInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface ComposeSpectralCoverageInput {
  participants:
    readonly SpectralCoverageParticipant[];
}
```

## DiscreteSpectralLineMeasure

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface DiscreteSpectralLineMeasure {
  wavelengthBasis:
    ResolvedSpectralWavelengthBasis;
  quantityUnit:
    DiscreteSpectralLineQuantityUnit;
  lineModel: "delta-like-integrated";
  lines:
    readonly DiscreteSpectralLineMeasureEntry[];
  continuousSpectralDensityAssumed: false;
  wavelengthMeasureMultiplicationRequired:
    false;
}
```

## DiscreteSpectralLineMeasureEntry

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface DiscreteSpectralLineMeasureEntry {
  lineId: string;
  wavelengthNanometers: number;

}
```

## DiscreteSpectralLineQuantityUnit

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export type DiscreteSpectralLineQuantityUnit =
  | "relative"
  | "W/sr"
  | "W/m^2"
  | "W/m^2/sr";
```

## DistributeIntegratedQuantityAcrossDiscreteLinesInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface DistributeIntegratedQuantityAcrossDiscreteLinesInput {
  distribution:
    NormalizedDiscreteSpectralLineDistribution;
  totalIntegratedQuantity: number;
  quantityUnit:
    DiscreteSpectralLineQuantityUnit;
}
```

## distributeIntegratedQuantityAcrossDiscreteSpectralLines

Distributes one wavelength-integrated quantity across normalized discrete
line fractions without inventing a continuous line width.

```ts
export function distributeIntegratedQuantityAcrossDiscreteSpectralLines(
  input:
    DistributeIntegratedQuantityAcrossDiscreteLinesInput
): DiscreteSpectralLineMeasure;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## IntegratedDiscreteSpectralLineMeasure

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface IntegratedDiscreteSpectralLineMeasure {
  wavelengthBasis:
    ResolvedSpectralWavelengthBasis;
  quantityUnit:
    DiscreteSpectralLineQuantityUnit;
  integratedQuantity: number;
  lineCount: number;
  continuousQuadratureApplied: false;
  wavelengthMeasureMultiplicationApplied:
    false;
}
```

## integrateDiscreteSpectralLineMeasure

Integrates over discrete lines by summing their contributions, which are already
integrated over wavelength. No dλ (wavelength step) factor is applied.

```ts
export function integrateDiscreteSpectralLineMeasure(
  measure:
    DiscreteSpectralLineMeasure
): IntegratedDiscreteSpectralLineMeasure;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## NormalizedDiscreteSpectralLine

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface NormalizedDiscreteSpectralLine {
  lineId: string;
  wavelengthNanometers: number;
  normalizedIntegratedWeight: number;
}
```

## NormalizedDiscreteSpectralLineDistribution

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface NormalizedDiscreteSpectralLineDistribution {
  wavelengthBasis:
    ResolvedSpectralWavelengthBasis;
  lineModel: "delta-like-integrated";
  normalization:
    "sum-normalized-integrated-weight-to-one";
  lines:
    readonly NormalizedDiscreteSpectralLine[];
}
```

## parseNormalizedDiscreteSpectralLineDistribution

Parses a normalized set of discrete spectral lines (each treated as a delta function).

Each weight is the fraction of the total carried by that line. It is not a
per-nanometre density sample. The weights must sum to one.

```ts
export function parseNormalizedDiscreteSpectralLineDistribution(
  value: unknown,
  path =
    "discreteSpectralLineDistribution"
): NormalizedDiscreteSpectralLineDistribution;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## parseSpectralCoverageParticipant

Parses the wavelength coverage of one continuous spectral input.

It describes only the wavelength range (support) and interpolation breakpoints. It
carries no spectral values, transmission, response, radiance or uncertainty.

```ts
export function parseSpectralCoverageParticipant(
  value: unknown,
  path = "spectralCoverageParticipant"
): SpectralCoverageParticipant;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## ResolvedSpectralWavelengthBasis

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export type ResolvedSpectralWavelengthBasis =
  Exclude<SpectralWavelengthBasis, "unspecified">;
```

## SpectralCoverageComposition

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

   * strictly inside the common overlap.

  /**
   * Internal piecewise-continuous breakpoints. Range endpoints are carried
   * separately and must not be duplicated here.
   */
  breakpointsNanometers:
    readonly number[];
}
```

## SpectralCoverageParticipantRole

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts

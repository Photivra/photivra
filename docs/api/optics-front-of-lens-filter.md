# optics/front-of-lens-filter.ts public contracts

The package and root API versions are recorded once in [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](../DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## composeFrontOfLensFilterTransmission

Composes multiple passive front-of-lens filters at one wavelength in light-path order while
preserving each component's identity. Without a polarizer this is the plain product of
transmissions; with one, linear Stokes parameters propagate through the ordered Mueller chain.

```ts
export function composeFrontOfLensFilterTransmission(
  input:
    ComposeFrontOfLensFilterTransmissionInput
): ComposedFrontOfLensFilterTransmission;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

  wavelengthNanometers: number;
  wavelengthBasis:
    Exclude<

```ts
export interface LinearPolarizationState {

  /** Electric-field polarization angle, degrees counter-clockwise from image +X. */

## parseFrontOfLensFilterProfile

Parses one generic front-of-lens transmission filter.

Schema 0.1.0 is explicitly unbranded and unpolarized. It models only
passive transmission placed before the lens. Reflections between stacked
filters, polarization, flare/ghosting and wavelength-changing behavior are
outside this contract.

```ts
export function parseFrontOfLensFilterProfile(
  value: unknown
): FrontOfLensFilterProfile;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## ResolvedFrontOfLensFilterTransmission

    FrontOfLensFilterProfileSchemaVersion;

    "photivra-generic-unbranded";
  position: "front-of-lens";

  wavelengthBasis:
    Exclude<
      SpectralWavelengthBasis,
      "unspecified"
    >;

  uncertainty:

  evidence: readonly EvidenceProvenance[];

}
```

## resolveFrontOfLensFilterTransmission

Resolves one passive filter at one wavelength. Non-polarizing filters scale all Stokes
components equally, so their transmission does not depend on the incident polarization.

```ts
export function resolveFrontOfLensFilterTransmission(
  input:
    ResolveFrontOfLensFilterTransmissionInput
): ResolvedFrontOfLensFilterTransmission;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## ResolveFrontOfLensFilterTransmissionInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface ResolveFrontOfLensFilterTransmissionInput {
  profile: FrontOfLensFilterProfile;
  wavelengthNanometers: number;
  wavelengthBasis:
    Exclude<
      SpectralWavelengthBasis,
      "unspecified"
    >;
  /** Incident polarization; omitted means unpolarized. */
  incidentPolarization?: LinearPolarizationState;
}
```

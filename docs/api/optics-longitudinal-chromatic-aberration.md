# optics/longitudinal-chromatic-aberration.ts public contracts

The package and root API versions are recorded once in [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](../DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## calculateCauchyRefractiveIndex

Two-term Cauchy refractive index fitted to n_d and V_d. Valid as an approximation over
360-830 nm only.

```ts
export function calculateCauchyRefractiveIndex(input: {
  refractiveIndexD: number;
  abbeNumberD: number;
  wavelengthNm: number;
}): CalculationResult<{ refractiveIndex: number }>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## calculateLongitudinalChromaticFocus

Wavelength-dependent focus for one wavelength: focal length, image distance, signed defocus at
a sensor focused at the reference wavelength, geometric blur and the defocus wavefront.

```ts
export function calculateLongitudinalChromaticFocus(
  input: CalculateLongitudinalChromaticFocusInput
): CalculationResult<LongitudinalChromaticFocus>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## CalculateLongitudinalChromaticFocusInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface CalculateLongitudinalChromaticFocusInput {
  /** Focal length at the reference wavelength, in mm. */
  focalLengthMm: number;
  /** Wavelength at which the sensor is focused, in nm. */
  referenceWavelengthNm: number;
  /** Wavelength to evaluate, in nm (same wavelength basis as the dispersion data). */
  wavelengthNm: number;
  /** Nominal f-number at the reference wavelength (entrance-pupil diameter = f / N). */
  apertureFNumber: number;
  /** Focus (object) distance at the reference wavelength, metres from the principal plane. */
  focusDistanceM: number;
  /** Subject distance in metres; defaults to focusDistanceM. */
  subjectDistanceM?: number;
  dispersion: LongitudinalChromaticDispersion;
}
```

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
FRAUNHOFER_C_LINE_NM = 656.2725
```

## FRAUNHOFER_D_LINE_NM

Fraunhofer spectral-line wavelengths in nm (ISO 7944 reference wavelengths).

      abbeNumberD: number;
    }
  | {
      kind: "declared-focal-shift";
      /** Strictly increasing wavelengths; shift is f(lambda) - f_nominal in micrometres. */
      samples: readonly {
        wavelengthNm: number;
        focalLengthShiftMicrometers: number;
      }[];
    };

# sensor/spatial-sample-reduction.ts public contracts

The package and root API versions are recorded once in [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## reduceSensorSpatialSamplingQuadrature

Combines nonnegative linear values, each tagged with its node, over a
validated sensor spatial quadrature.

It does not sample a renderer or optical model itself. Callers evaluate one
value at every node's preAntiAliasingSourcePointMm and pass the values with
their exact node identity. Order does not matter.

Two value domains are supported:

- relative-linear: a dimensionless, nonnegative stand-in for irradiance, for
  deterministic renderer and science regression tests;
- radiometric-irradiance: physical irradiance on the sensor plane in W/m^2.

The destination site's channelId is a label only. No CFA spectral
transmittance or sensitivity is applied, so do not call the output a
colour-filtered mosaic sample or a RAW value.

```ts
export function reduceSensorSpatialSamplingQuadrature(
  input: ReduceSensorSpatialSamplingQuadratureInput
): CalculationResult<SensorSpatialSampleReduction>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## ReduceSensorSpatialSamplingQuadratureInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

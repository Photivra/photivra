# camera/lens-projection.ts public contracts

The package and root API versions are recorded once in [Navigation](../API_REFERENCE.md) · [Developer guide](../DEVELOPERS.md). Generated signatures retain independent schema/model versions. Only the exports listed here are root-package contracts; module-local helpers are not supported deep imports.

## calculateLensProjectionDirection

Inverse-maps one image-plane point to its unit camera-frame scene direction under the declared
projection model. Points outside the model's image circle (or outside +/-pi longitude and
+/-pi/2 latitude for equirectangular) are rejected.

```ts
export function calculateLensProjectionDirection(
  input: CalculateLensProjectionDirectionInput
): CalculationResult<LensProjectionDirection>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## CalculateLensProjectionDirectionInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface CalculateLensProjectionDirectionInput {
  projectionModel: LensProjectionModel;
  focalLengthMm: number;
  /** Image-plane point relative to the optical axis, in millimetres. */
  imagePointMm: { x: number; y: number };
}
```

## calculateLensProjectionFieldOfView

Angular field of view across a centred sensor dimension along one axis through the optical
axis: 2 * theta(d / 2) for radial models and d / f for equirectangular.

For equirectangular the result is the longitude span when the dimension is horizontal and the
latitude span when it is vertical. Sensor dimensions larger than a fisheye's image circle are
rejected rather than clipped.

```ts
export function calculateLensProjectionFieldOfView(
  input: CalculateLensProjectionFieldOfViewInput
): CalculationResult<LensProjectionFieldOfView>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## calculateLensProjectionFieldOfViewBounds

Asymmetric angular span between two signed sensor coordinates on one axis through the optical
axis, for off-centre crops.

```ts
export function calculateLensProjectionFieldOfViewBounds(
  input: CalculateLensProjectionFieldOfViewBoundsInput
): CalculationResult<LensProjectionFieldOfViewBounds>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## CalculateLensProjectionFieldOfViewBoundsInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface CalculateLensProjectionFieldOfViewBoundsInput {
  projectionModel: LensProjectionModel;
  focalLengthMm: number;
  /** Signed minimum sensor coordinate along one axis through the optical axis, in mm. */
  minimumSensorCoordinateMm: number;
  /** Signed maximum sensor coordinate along the same axis, in mm. */
  maximumSensorCoordinateMm: number;
}
```

## CalculateLensProjectionFieldOfViewInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface CalculateLensProjectionFieldOfViewInput {
  projectionModel: LensProjectionModel;
  focalLengthMm: number;
  /** Centred sensor/capture dimension along one axis through the optical axis, in mm. */
  sensorDimensionMm: number;
}
```

## calculateLensProjectionImagePoint

Maps one camera-frame scene direction to its ideal image-plane point under the declared
projection model.

```ts
export function calculateLensProjectionImagePoint(
  input: CalculateLensProjectionImagePointInput
): CalculationResult<LensProjectionImagePoint>;
```

This call is synchronous; any supplied provider must follow its explicit synchronous contract.

## CalculateLensProjectionImagePointInput

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts
export interface CalculateLensProjectionImagePointInput {
  projectionModel: LensProjectionModel;
  /**
   * Projection scale in millimetres: the focal length f of the mapping function, or for
   * equirectangular the image distance per radian.
   */
  focalLengthMm: number;
  /** Scene direction in the camera frame. Need not be normalized; must be non-zero. */
  direction: LensDirection;
}
```

## LENS_PROJECTION_MODELS

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

  y: number;
  /** Camera-frame direction component along the optical axis toward the scene. */
  z: number;
}
```

## LensProjectionDirection

The exact contract is declared below; use the domain guide for assumptions and staged integration.

```ts

  /** Distance of the image point from the optical axis, in millimetres. */
  imageRadiusMm: number;
}
```

## LensProjectionModel

  | "equirectangular";
```

## parseLensProjectionModel

Fail-closed runtime parser for the projection discriminator.

```ts

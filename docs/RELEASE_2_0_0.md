# 2.0.0 release candidate

> **Candidate record, prepared October 17, 2026.** This is the production release request for `@photivra/engine@2.0.0`. Preparing it does not tag, publish or create a GitHub release. **Tagging `v2.0.0` triggers npm publishing and requires the owner's explicit approval.**

## At a glance

- **What is proposed:** publish `@photivra/engine@2.0.0`, with `ENGINE_API_VERSION = "2.0.0"` and `POC_SIMULATION_API_VERSION = "1.0.0"`.
- **Why the version goes from 1 to 2:** the owner directed a single major release containing every fix, optimization and new feature from the 2.0 deep review, including breaking API and schema changes. Some of these changes alter results, stored identities (hashes, seeds) or the input that is accepted. Under the 1.0 root-package compatibility policy, such changes require a major version.
- **What is ready:** all work streams are merged, the version numbers are aligned, the changelog is written, and the citation audit is done.
- **What still needs the owner:** the [pending owner decisions](#pending-owner-decisions), a substantive human review of the AI-assisted changes and of this record, green CI on the exact release commit, and explicit approval to tag `v2.0.0`. See the [remaining release checklist](#remaining-release-checklist).
- **What this release does not claim:** calibrated physical accuracy for any real camera, lens or sensor. Tier presets remain synthetic.

## Candidate details

**Candidate base:** `origin/main` at `28f8b61` (#314), the last code change. This record update changes `CHANGELOG.md`, this file, `THIRD_PARTY.md`, `README.md` (the Adobe DNG notice) and one source comment (the same notice in `src/capture/dng-import.ts`); the comment-stripped build is unchanged.

- `npm run release:prepare -- 2.0.0` had already aligned `package.json`, both lockfile root versions, `ENGINE_API_VERSION`, `CITATION.cff`, the current-release lines in `README.md` and `docs/DEVELOPERS.md`, and the generated `docs/api`.
- After the merge, the API reference was regenerated.
- No citation release date is stated before publication.

**All streams merged:** the lean per-site executor (#305), the `simulateCapture()` integration of the 2.0 features (#306) and the native RAW DNG writer (#307) are merged, as are the AGENTS.md reset (#308), the plain-language pass (#309–#312), the agent docs (#313) and the free-source citations (#314). All are listed in the [changelog](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Scope

Changes since `v1.5.0`, all merged to `main`. In the "Kind" column, *Breaking* means existing users may get different results or errors; *Additive* means new features only; *Performance (bit-identical)* means faster with exactly the same output.

Commits #243–#267, between `v1.5.0` and the first review, are guidance, CI, documentation, hooks, `release:prepare` and repository-internal browser-native reference work. They change no public root contract. The full release notes, with a migration for each breaking change, are in the [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md).

## Science evidence

How to read this section: each entry names one change, the model and version it uses, the accepted science and sources behind it, and the committed deterministic tests that check it.

- Free sources are preferred, following the [citation audit](#citation-audit-free-sources). A paid standard appears only as "also specified in", or where no free equivalent was found.
- Nothing in this release establishes calibrated physical accuracy for any real camera, lens or sensor. Tier presets remain synthetic.

### RAW noise seeding (#283) and noise model (#290)

- **Model and version:** `photivra-native-raw-noise` 0.4.0; seed schedule v2; charge realization 3.0.0; RAW code 4.0.0.
- **Accepted science and sources:**
  - Linear camera model and photon-transfer noise of EMVA Standard 1288 Release 4.0 (free from emva.org): Poisson signal electrons, independent Gaussian read noise, gain, quantization.
  - Also see: J. R. Janesick, *Photon Transfer* (SPIE, 2007).
  - Poisson sampling by Hörmann's PTRS (1993) and Box–Muller (1958), with the normal approximation for very large means (NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook §1.3.6.6.19 and SOCR, University of Michigan, free; also see Johnson, Kemp & Kotz, *Univariate Discrete Distributions*, 3rd ed.).
  - Seeds from the public-domain MurmurHash3_x86_32/`fmix32`. Independence is shown statistically.
- **Evidence in the repository:** `test/sensor-raw-noise-independence.test.ts` (Poisson mean/variance, spatial and cross-seed independence within pre-declared 5σ bands; the old schedule fails at lag correlation 0.84), `test/sensor-readout-v2.test.ts`.

### ISO-to-gain and fixed-pattern noise (#290)

- **Model and version:** `createIsoGainReadoutRegimes`; `photivra-sensor-fixed-pattern` 1.0.0; expected readout 2.0.0.
- **Accepted science and sources:**
  - Exposure index S = 10/H and focal-plane exposure H = 0.65·L·t/N² from CIPA DC-004-2020 (free; also ISO 12232:2019).
  - EMVA 1288 Release 4.0: system gain K, PRNU, DSNU, linearity, dark current versus temperature. (PRNU and DSNU are the pixel-to-pixel variations in response to light and in dark signal.)
  - Exponential dependence of dark current on temperature: EMVA 1288 Release 4.0 Linear §3.2 (free); also see Janesick (2007).
  - Dual conversion gain is a declared per-mode read noise, never derived from S.
- **Evidence in the repository:** `test/iso-brightness.test.ts`, `test/sensor-readout-v2.test.ts`, `test/independent-radiometric-oracle.test.ts` (independent camera-equation RAW oracle).

### Depth of field and defocus (#279, #293)

- **Model and version:** `thin-lens-depth-of-field` 1.1.0; defocus circle 1.1.0.
- **Accepted science and sources:** exact thin-lens limits from the blur-circle condition; J. E. Greivenkamp, OPTI-502 course notes, sec. 12 (free); also see S. F. Ray, *Applied Photographic Optics*, 3rd ed. (2002). The defocus closed form is an algebraic rearrangement of the same model. Geometric only.
- **Evidence in the repository:** `test/optics.test.ts` (exact rational references, a property test with 300+ cases, hyperfocal cases).

### Camera rotation sign (#284)

- **Model and version:** rotation and stabilization models 2.0.0.
- **Accepted science and sources:** right-hand-rule rigid rotation with standard rotation matrices. The camera basis is left-handed, so the physical matrix is the transpose of the component Rodrigues form.
- **Evidence in the repository:** `test/camera-rotation-sign-consistency.test.ts`.

### Complex-pupil PSF sampling (#284, #293)

PSF = point-spread function: the pattern a lens makes from a single point of light.

- **Model and version:** complex-pupil PSF 2.0.0.
- **Accepted science and sources:**
  - Incoherent PSF = \|FT{pupil}\|², OTF cutoff D/(λz), Nyquist Q = λN/pitch ≥ 2: MIT OpenCourseWare 2.71 lecture 22 and Ban et al., arXiv:2511.06936 (free); also see J. W. Goodman, *Introduction to Fourier Optics*, 4th ed. (2017).
  - Q notation from Fiete, *Opt. Eng.* 38(7) (1999).
  - The no-wrap condition M ≥ 2S − 1 follows from DFT circular convolution.
- **Evidence in the repository:** `test/lens-psf-framework.test.ts` (Dirichlet kernel, analytic Airy comparison, support rejection).

### Cross-engine determinism (#293)

The aim: the same inputs give bit-identical stored results in every JavaScript engine.

- **Model and version:** crop models 2.0.0; 35 mm crop factor.
- **Accepted science and sources:** IEEE 754-2019 §5.4 requires correct rounding of +, −, ×, ÷ and sqrt. ECMA-262 §21.3.2 leaves `Math` functions approximated by each implementation. Hashed paths therefore use only correctly rounded operations and portable kernels.
- **Evidence in the repository:** `test/portable-math.test.ts`, `test/crop-integer-rounding.test.ts`, the POC hash corpus, and the macOS hash-lock CI job.

### Colorimetry (#291)

- **Model and version:** `COLORIMETRY_MODEL_VERSION` 2.0.0.
- **Accepted science and sources:**

- **CMFs:** the engine's own least-squares fit of a sum of split Gaussians (the model form of Wyman, Sloan & Shirley 2013, free; none of its coefficients) to the CIE 1931 2° table, DOI 10.25039/CIE.DS.xvudnb9b, used at fit time only (`scripts/fit-cie-1931-cmf.mjs`). Measured maximum / RMS error against the table: x̄ 0.0122 / 0.00426, ȳ 0.00733 / 0.00265, z̄ 0.0221 / 0.00397, each at or below the Wyman coefficients' 0.0140 / 0.00559, 0.00800 / 0.00267 and 0.0222 / 0.00399. Labelled approximation.
- **Planckian locus:** chromaticity of Planck's law (BIPM *Mise en pratique* for the kelvin, free; exact c₂ = hc/k, CODATA) integrated against those CMFs on 1 nm nodes, 1000–100000 K. Against a locus integrated with the CIE table it is within 2.83e-4 in uv from 2856 to 25000 K (1.05e-3 at 1667 K). The CCT/Duv search uses it by default.
- **Evidence in the repository:** `test/colorimetry.test.ts` (non-negative, equal-area CMFs with a unit ȳ peak near 555 nm; monotonic locus equal to the explicit Planck integral; illuminant A as a Planckian radiator; McCamy within 20 K over 2856–6504 K; CCT/Duv round trips; Duv sign; CIEDE2000 closed forms), `test/colorimetry-output-and-camera.test.ts`, re-pinned digests in `test/simulate-capture-integration.test.ts`. Numbers and method in `docs/COLORIMETRY.md`. The tests contain no CIE table values.

## Citation audit (free sources)

The owner's rule is that releases rely only on free-to-use sources. Every paid or paywalled standard cited by 2.0 work is listed below, with the free source used instead.

Free standards bodies and documents already in use need no change: CIPA (DC-003, DC-004, DC-008), ITU-R and ITU-T recommendations, EMVA 1288, the Adobe DNG and TIFF 6.0 specifications, ICC specifications, W3C recommendations, IETF RFCs, the BIPM SI Brochure, and the CIE free datasets.

In the Status column: **Replaced** means a free source now backs the fact. **Removed** means the engine no longer depends on the paid source: the fact is derived in the documentation or stated as the engine's own convention. **Accepted** means no free text of the formula exists, and the owner accepted it on free evidence (see [pending owner decisions](#pending-owner-decisions)).

| Paid source | Fact used | Free replacement | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ISO 12232:2019 | Exposure index S = 10/H; H ∝ 1/S; H = 0.65·L·t/N² | CIPA DC-004-Translation-2020, *Sensitivity of Digital Cameras*, §3.2–3.3 and §5.5 — <https://www.cipa.jp/e/std/std-sec.html> | Replaced |
| ISO 12232:2019 | Saturation-based speed S_sat = 78/H_sat (test oracle, Quick Start remark, highlight-priority headroom remark) | Removed. The ISO-brightness test now uses the CIPA DC-004-2020 standard output sensitivity H_m = 10/S (§3.2), whose reference level is an 18 % grey (§5.2, Explanation 1 and 2.2), so mid-grey is 0.18 of the white exposure — <https://www.cipa.jp/e/std/std-sec.html>. The Quick Start and highlight-priority remarks cite DC-004 and state the half-stop headroom as the engine's own documented choice. No engine output changed. | Replaced (owner decision 1) |
| ISO 2720:1974 | Reflected-light meter constant K = 12.5 cd·s/m² (facade exposure anchor) | Removed. The facade uses CIPA DC-004-2020 S = 10/H (§3.2) and H = 0.65·L·t/N² (§5.5 (4), Explanation 4) — <https://www.cipa.jp/e/std/std-sec.html>. This is equivalent to K = 10/0.65 ≈ 15.38. The default illuminance changes from π·12.5·64·125/18 ≈ 17 453.29 lux to π·80 000/11.7 ≈ 21 480.98 lux (recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`). | Replaced (owner decision 2) |
| ISO 12233:2017 | Slanted-edge chart geometry | P. D. Burns, "Slanted-Edge MTF for Digital Camera and Scanner Analysis", IS&T PICS 2000 — <https://www.imaging.org/common/uploaded%20files/pdfs/Papers/2000/PICS-0-81/1621.pdf> | Replaced |
| ISO 2827 | Guide-number measurement | Citation removed. `docs/SCENE_SENSOR_TEMPORAL_EXPOSURE.md` derives GN = d·N, the √p and the √(ISO/100) scaling from the inverse-square law and the DC-004 camera equation. The engine does not model how a guide number is measured; the caller supplies it. | Removed (owner decision 3) |

The quadrature and the normalization k are explicit engine choices. | Replaced (owner decision 4) |
| CIE 15:2018 / ISO/CIE 11664-2 | Illuminant A formula | Planck's law: BIPM *Mise en pratique* for the kelvin, Absolute Primary Radiometry (2018), Eq. 1 — <https://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si-mep/MeP-K-2018_Absolute_Primary_Radiometry.pdf>. The engine uses the CIE's constants c₂ = 1.435e-2 m·K and T = 2848 K (the exact c₂ = hc/k = 1.438 776 877…e-2 m·K, NIST CODATA 2022, is used only for the Planckian radiator). These two constants have no free source text, but the formula reproduces all 531 values of the free CIE 1 nm table (DOI 10.25039/CIE.DS.8jsxjrsn) within 4.8e-6 relative, the table's rounding. | Replaced (owner decision 4); constants verified for free |
| CIE 15:2018 | Daylight-locus polynomial and M₁/M₂ | No free copy found. The source paper, Judd, MacAdam & Wyszecki, *JOSA* 54(8):1031 (1964), doi:10.1364/JOSA.54.001031, is subscription-only on the publisher's site; the only other copy found was an unauthorized upload. The coefficients were checked against the free CIE datasets: with three-decimal rounding they reproduce D55 within 5.0e-4 and D65 within 8.5e-4 at every 5 nm node (the tables' rounding). **Owner decision (2026-10-17):** accepted on that evidence. The datasets are free to download under CC BY-SA 4.0; they are cited and compared against, never bundled, so the licence does not bind the package (see [Rights and licensing](#rights-and-licensing)). The polynomial coefficients are scientific facts, not licensed material. | Accepted (owner decision); values verified for free |

The sign follows these slides; the engine documents it (docs, runtime assumption text) and a test checks that a greenish light gives a positive Duv. Ohno, LEUKOS 10(1), 2014 is not cited: NIST's record of it (<https://www.nist.gov/publications/practical-use-and-calculation-cct-and-duv>) links only to the paywalled publisher copy. | Replaced (owner decision 5) |

**What changed:** doc comments in `src/`, and the reference lists in `docs/` and `THIRD_PARTY.md`, now cite the free source first. The paid standard is kept only as "also specified in".

**Runtime strings (owner decision).** Provenance `sources` arrays, `assumptions` text and error messages that named paid standards now name the free sources above. This is a text-only output change; no number changed. Limitation and error strings that used internal ticket numbers as model names (#12, #14, #85, #110) now use the model names. See `CHANGELOG.md`. Test comments are not shipped and were left as they were. The result model id `rgb-xyz-matrix-smpte-rp177` of `calculateRgbToXyzMatrices` is an identifier, not a citation, and was not renamed.

**Resolved:** no flagged items remain. The CIE daylight locus and M₁/M₂ were accepted by the owner on the evidence of the free CIE datasets.

## Free sources for textbook citations

The owner's free-sources rule also covers paid textbooks. For each fact a paid book was cited for, a free source that states the same fact was found, read and added first. The book is kept as "also see". The change is limited to `docs/` and `src/` comments; runtime strings, tests and the standards rows above are unchanged.

"Free" here means free to read online. Two of the sources are author-hosted copies of copyrighted work (Wyant & Creath; Rump & Jeannerod), and the course notes are copyrighted by their authors or institutions. Only facts are cited; nothing is copied.

**Facts with no free source found:**

- **Guide number GN = d·N** (Jacobson et al.; Ray). No free source states the relation itself. Both of its parts are freely sourced: the inverse-square law (NIST SP 250-37, <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication250-37.pdf>) and the camera equation (Greivenkamp, OPTI-502 sec. 11). The relation follows by algebra. The guide-number measurement procedure stays with ISO 2827, in the audit above.

**Not changed:**

- Test comments (`test/independent-radiometric-oracle.test.ts` and `test/native-environment-bit-identity.test.ts` cite Smith and Hecht for the camera equation; `test/sensor-raw-noise-independence.test.ts` cites Janesick). Test comments are not shipped, and tests are out of scope here. Greivenkamp OPTI-502 sec. 11 and EMVA 1288 §2.4 are free sources for those facts.
- `CHANGELOG.md` names "Goodman sampling Q > 2" in a dated entry. Ban et al. above is the free source.
- Paywalled journal papers that are not textbooks (for example Noll 1976, Mahajan 1982, Miyamoto 1964, Fiete 1999) are outside this pass.

## Rights and licensing

- **No CIE tables bundled.** The CIE 1931 colour-matching-function and daylight-component datasets are licensed CC BY-SA 4.0 (dataset metadata, e.g. DOI 10.25039/CIE.DS.xvudnb9b). ShareAlike is incompatible with Apache-2.0-only distribution. The engine therefore uses its own analytic CMF fit and tables supplied by the caller. The fit script downloads the CIE 1931 table into a temporary directory at fit time only; no CIE value is in the repository, the package or the tests (owner decision, 2026-10-17). The docs cite CIE datasets as external evidence with comparison numbers we computed. No ColorChecker or other reflectance data is included.
- **Removed by owner decision (2026-10-17):** the Wyman, Sloan & Shirley (2013) CMF coefficients (paper CC BY-ND 3.0), replaced by the engine's own fit; and the Kim/Kang et al. (2002) Planckian-locus cubic-spline coefficients (also claimed in US 7,024,034, which the USPTO record lists as lapsed on April 4, 2018), replaced by Planck's law integrated against the engine's CMFs. No coefficient of either set and no patent text remains in `src/`.
- **Patent review of 2.0 algorithms (2026-10-17):** see the new section of the same name in `THIRD_PARTY.md`. The Malvar–He–Cutler demosaic was removed because US 7,502,505 is still in force. PQ and HLG were removed because Dolby, the BBC and Thomson filed only licence-on-request declarations (free of charge or RAND), not licences or non-asserts; NHK filed no HLG declaration.
- **Unclear-licence test inputs replaced (2026-10-17):** the Bradford test no longer uses a matrix and D65/D50 whites from a secondary website. It follows ICC.1:2010 Annex E (free, permissive ICC licence), with D65 from its ITU-R BT.709-6 chromaticity and D50 the ICC PCS illuminant.
- **CIEDE2000 test pairs removed:** the Sharma, Wu & Dalal (2005) data file has no licence, and the page's only terms limit the authors' program and spreadsheet to personal or research use. The tests now check closed-form special cases computed from the formula.
- **Adobe DNG patent licence (verified 2026-10-17; owner decision).** Adobe's licence (Digital Negative page, <https://helpx.adobe.com/camera-raw/desktop/dng-and-file-formats/digital-negative.html>) is royalty-free, covers reading and writing DNG, and requires the notice "This product includes DNG technology under license by Adobe." in source code and documentation. It is now in `NOTICE`, `README.md` and all three DNG source files (the reader `dng-import.ts` was added). Its only condition beyond the notice is revocation for a licensee that sues Adobe over DNG patents. No conflict with Apache-2.0 was found. This is a document check, not legal advice. See `THIRD_PARTY.md`. A retrieval record (URL, date, page SHA-256, exact notice, summary) is kept at `docs/licenses/adobe-dng-patent-license-record.txt`. The full licence text is not copied, because Adobe's General Terms of Use (sections 3.2 and 6.2) do not clearly allow copying text from its websites.
- **Owner decisions (2026-10-17) on free, licence-compatible inputs:** ship DNG under Adobe's royalty-free licence. An earlier decision that day kept the Wyman et al. parameters and the Kang et al. coefficients; the owner then decided to remove every third-party number with any licence question, so both were removed (above).
- **DNG ActiveArea phase rule (confirmed).**
  - The Adobe DNG Specification 1.7.1.0 (September 2023) was downloaded from Adobe's Digital Negative page.
  - Under PhotometricInterpretation (PDF page 22) it states: "The origin of the repeating CFA pattern is the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle". Under BlackLevel (PDF page 28): "The origin of this pattern is the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle".
  - The #295 correction, which takes BlackLevel and CFAPattern phases relative to the ActiveArea origin, and the DNG importer both follow this rule.
  - Compatibility Issue 2 (16-bit lossless JPEG before DNG 1.1.0.0) is as cited in `docs/IMPORT_AND_PNG.md`.
  - The specification is free to download. It is © Adobe, and only factual tag definitions are used.
- **MurmurHash3** is an independent implementation of the public-domain algorithm (Austin Appleby, SMHasher), checked against published test vectors and recorded in `THIRD_PARTY.md`.
- **No third-party code, model weights or calibration data added.**
  - The JPEG DCT constants are computed by the engine.
  - The PNG zlib/DEFLATE encoder and the DNG/lossless JPEG readers are written in-house from free specifications.
  - AVIF and HEIC are not implemented, which avoids codec patent licensing.
  - Test oracles under `test/helpers/` are frozen copies of this repository's own Apache-2.0 code.
- **No new runtime dependency.** `npm ls --omit=dev` stays empty. The SPDX header, licence, identity and browser-surface gates run in `npm run check:static`.
- Every included commit carries the owner's DCO `Signed-off-by`, under the owner's October 11, 2026 policy. AI-assisted material still needs the owner's substantive human review before release.

## Privacy and security

- **No network, persistence or telemetry.** The root package makes no network request, stores nothing and collects nothing. In the browser it touches only `performance.now()`, for yield timing, and — only when the caller opts in — `navigator.gpu` (see WebGPU below). The browser-surface gate covers every reachable root module.
- **Parsers for untrusted input.** `parseDngRawImage` and `parseLosslessJpeg`:
  - bounds-check every offset and count;
  - detect IFD loops and aliases;
  - cap IFDs (default 64, at most 1,024) and pixels (default 64 MP, at most 200 MP) before allocating;
  - check a JPEG frame against the strip's sample count, to stop decompression bombs;
  - apply strict Huffman, marker and range checks.

  `serializePngImage` validates its input against `PNG_ENCODER_LIMITS`. JSON entry points reject non-plain objects, holes and unknown fields instead of silently hashing them; this also removes a way for different inputs to produce the same identity. There is no corpus of real-camera DNG files, so interoperability with camera files is not claimed.
- **WebGPU is opt-in.** `createImageKernelAccelerator()` touches `navigator.gpu` (or a GPU object supplied by the caller) only when called, never at import. Results are labelled `webgpu-f32` with an error bound, and the CPU reference stays the default. Shaders are fixed engine code; no caller code is compiled.
- **POC server (repository-only, not in the package).** Fixed messages for 413/422/500 and for malformed-JSON 400 reveal less than before. It stays loopback-oriented, unauthenticated and for development only.
- **Package surface.** The package no longer ships declaration maps, internal guides or unreachable modules. The JS source maps embed only this repository's TypeScript sources.

Other contract changes:

- new required RAW and sensor result fields;
- `createNativeRawDevelopmentTask` takes ownership of `input.raw`;
- stricter input validation (non-plain JSON, unknown scalar fields, plan version/fingerprint mismatches);
- widened unions (white-balance source, metering policy, readout synchronization, filter polarization, geometric transforms, blocker codes);
- a smaller package, without `prepare`, declaration maps or internal guides.

Root exports grow from 1,227 to 1,647 symbols. Comparing the generated `docs/api/exports.json` against `v1.5.0` shows none removed. New captures and plans record creator identity 2.0.0. Existing archives keep their identities, and fail closed where a bound identity changed.

## Known historical evidence not regenerated

These committed records are dated evidence tied to outputs from before 2.0.0. They are kept as written and are **not** 2.0.0 evidence:

- **`test/fixtures/producer-export-acceptance/` and `test/fixtures/paired-export-acceptance/`.** RAW, DNG and JPEG artifacts from engine 0.100 and 0.115, tied to external LibRaw/Adobe/editor review records. Regenerating them would orphan that evidence. Any new external review needs fresh 2.0.0 artifacts, which now differ in noise, white level, DNG tags and Exif.
- **`docs/validation/` records made with pre-2.0.0 behaviour**, such as `docs/validation/native-raw-print-2026-10-04/`, and the 1.2.0 #196 candidate inventory `docs/validation/print-196-candidate-evidence.json`. They remain valid records of the code that produced them. `docs/validation/tier-acceptance-report-v1.json` was regenerated in #284.

## Deferred items

Work that is known and deliberately left for later:

- **#305 follow-ups:** a provably identical fast path for provider-result validation; lean sensor-stage reuse.
- **#307 follow-ups:** real-camera DNG interoperability is not claimed (LibRaw decodes the files; no editor review yet); sharing the colour-tag code with the paired export.
- **#275:** a different native RAW default tile width (a plan-shape change); per-tap request retention (about 8 MB per site with a large PSF); parallel execution inside `simulateCapture()` (the engine-level row-band partitions are done).
- **#276 follow-up:** the `parse*()` versioned-record parsers and 13 record-taking functions still drop unknown top-level fields instead of rejecting them (each schema needs its own review, and this changes which stored records parse). Result values are frozen only at their top level (a deep freeze measured about 3× on hot scalar calls).
- **#277 and follow-ups from #304:**
  - scene radiance on the GPU (the CPU batched provider API now exists);
  - the per-fixture rollout, with method-error comparisons against the per-site engine;
  - hardware-GPU timings at 6–24 MP (the script `npm run bench:webgpu` exists; nothing has been measured);
  - hardware-GPU conformance runs and CI wiring;
  - kernel sampling from `LensPsfProfile`;
  - fixed-pattern noise and additional charge components in the GPU sensor stage;
  - GPU luminance tone curves.
- **Optics follow-ups from #303:** lens field mapping in the browser-native executor, mappings combined with ideal pupil rays, calibrated finite-focus fisheye scale.
- **Motion follow-ups from #297:** derived rolling exposure schedules in tier presets; time-varying angular velocity (rolling-shutter wobble).

## Pending owner decisions

1. **Flagged citations: decided.** Six of the seven items are replaced or removed (see the [citation audit](#citation-audit-free-sources)). On 2026-10-17 the owner accepted the seventh, the CIE daylight locus, on the evidence of the free CIE datasets, provided it is completely free and licence-compatible: the datasets are only cited and compared against, never bundled, and the coefficients are facts. Runtime strings now name free sources.
2. **Agent instructions reset.** At the owner's request (2026-10-16), `AGENTS.md` was replaced with a short standard file. It keeps three rules:
   - changes and recommendations must be evidence-based;
   - only free-to-use sources, data, code and methods may be used;
   - the owner approves anything that goes to production.

   `docs/AGENT_DOMAIN_RULES.md`, `docs/AUTOMATION_COORDINATION.md` and the `.github` agent files were retired. Their scientific content already lives in the domain guides, and `.github/node-lts-policy.mjs` still enforces the CI Node policy.
3. **Human review** of the AI-assisted changes and of this record. The third-party inputs were decided on 2026-10-17: the Wyman et al. CMF coefficients were replaced by the engine's own fit; the Kang et al. locus by Planck's law; CIE table values were removed from the tests; the Malvar–He–Cutler demosaic, PQ and HLG were removed; DNG is kept under Adobe's royalty-free licence, with a licence record file (`docs/licenses/adobe-dng-patent-license-record.txt`).

## Release gates

The authoritative result is GitHub CI on the exact commit that is tagged. The last code change is `28f8b61` (#314); its push CI on `main` is recorded below. This record update changes no code (documentation and one source comment), and gets its own CI run on its PR and again on `main` after merge. Tag the `main` commit whose CI is green.

| Gate | Result on `28f8b61` |
| --- | --- |
| Exact head SHA | `28f8b614af9d0aef59fd121f6ad02b0a77643d2a` |
| GitHub CI (all jobs, all Node versions) | Passed: [CI run 793](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/actions/runs/38996058927) and [Native performance run 66](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/actions/runs/38996058972) |
| `npm run check` (full vitest suite) | Passed on Node 22.13.0, lts/-1 and current (`verify` jobs) |
| `npm run coverage` (thresholds) | Passed (`verify (lts/*)` coverage gate) |
| `npm run build`, `pack:check`, `docs:check`, `release:consumer-check` | Passed (`verify` jobs: build, generated documentation, packed consumer acceptance, package dry run) |
| Informational macOS hash-lock job | Passed |

**Local results on this candidate** (`28f8b61` plus this record update, Node 24.21.0, linux/x64). The host was memory-limited, so the full vitest suite and coverage were not run locally; CI provides them.

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run check:static` | Passed: eslint, tsc, dependency licences (Apache-2.0 15, BlueOak-1.0.0 1, BSD-2-Clause 6, BSD-3-Clause 2, ISC 7, MIT 125, MPL-2.0 12), SPDX headers, identity, browser surface across 195 reachable modules. |
| `npm run build` | Passed (`tsc -p tsconfig.build.json`, from a clean `dist/`). |
| `npm run pack:check` | Passed: 776 files, 2,557,468 bytes packed, 11,809,315 unpacked; root export plus `./package.json`; 193 reachable modules; inline-source maps; no lifecycle scripts; local POC API excluded. |
| `npm run docs:check` | Passed: API reference current (1,637 root symbols across 176 modules); 280 Markdown files, 3,216 repository and local links, 103 importing examples, 26 explicit fragments. |
| `npm run release:consumer-check` | Passed: packed `@photivra/engine@2.0.0`; `require(esm)` and `lib: es2022`/DOM declaration consumers, 103 typed and running doc snippets, and the quick-start, simulate-capture and production/paired-export consumers. |

## Remaining release checklist

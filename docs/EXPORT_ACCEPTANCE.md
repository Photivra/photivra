# Simulated Sensor RAW DNG / JPEG acceptance

Release context: **package 1.2.0 candidate / root API 1.2.0**. Subsystem/model versions and dated introduction or measurement records below are independent historical identities; they are not distribution versions. See [developer navigation](DEVELOPERS.md) and [release contract](RELEASE_1_2_0.md).

This record separates implemented export behavior, reproducible independent
checks and external application acceptance for #16. The files are synthetic
Photivra captures, never photographs from a physical commercial camera.

## Current implemented boundary

`simulateEnvironmentSensorRawFrame()` executes supplied analytic environment
queries through the existing optics, wavelength/EQE, local temporal exposure,
dark/charge/capacity, seeded shot/read noise and ADC pipeline. Its exact native
post-ADC CFA frame feeds `createPhotographicExportPair()` and the shared #112
processed path. The serializer does not reconstruct the sensor simulation.
Attached manual RAW fixtures remain valid low-level serializer inputs, but are
not the evidence used here for producer-origin acceptance.

Provider transport, visibility, calibration and complete production-stage
activation are explicitly unverified. Source evaluation and authoritative
sensor-code production are executed; these are different claims. Bounded production integration is now merged in #178; provider transport and unsupported combinations remain explicit limits, not properties established by a DNG file. Child diagnostics remain accessible in the engine result.

The public export API requires explicit profiles, WB/rendering policy, identity,
workflow and event time. It copies validated data before asynchronous hashing.
The commercial app and calling runtime own file downloads. There is no file IO,
wall-clock sampling, service, new runtime dependency, Adobe SDK or competing
writer in the engine.

## Reproduce the acceptance files

```sh
node scripts/generate-producer-export-acceptance.mjs OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
python scripts/verify-producer-export-acceptance.py OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
```

The generator uses the existing repository dev compiler to compile only its
entry point and imported engine/owned fixture modules in a disposable directory.
It cleans that directory on success or failure. It is not an engine dependency
or package export. Run from a checkout with its normal dev dependencies installed.
The Python verifier requires independently installed Pillow, lxml and LibRaw.
Missing required independent tooling is a failure, not a passing skipped check.

Five 72×48 native pairs are committed in
`test/fixtures/producer-export-acceptance/`: landscape, both portrait directions,
inverted landscape and manual WB. Each represents an explicitly identified
shutter event with distinct artifact IDs; the controlled cases use the same seed
and physical/noise inputs, so orientation and metadata-WB variations preserve
all native codes and RAW-data identity. Portrait JPEGs are 48×72, upright JPEG
orientation is 1, and DNG retains native 72×48 pixels with its orientation tag.

These are explicit #130-derived camera/exposure/seed/units variants. The source
is an owned three-zone analytic angular environment at 400–500 nm, not the
canonical Lambertian target or a measured calibration. Optical transmission,
EQE, uniform aperture response, absent AA/PSF and direct noiseless source
radiance remain named approximations. Physical sampling uses square 500 µm
pitch, a declared 0.8×0.6-pitch sensitive aperture, one aperture midpoint and
one shutter midpoint, with two spectral nodes. Each capture executes 6,912
provider queries. This is bounded reference evidence, not native camera pixel
pitch, high-resolution output, measured accuracy or convergence evidence.

The actual generated samples include signed-noise shadows below BlackLevel 64,
physical clipping and ADC clipping at WhiteLevel 1023. Original RAW integers,
not an RGB screenshot or later tone curve, supply the DNG. The manual-WB case
changes AsShotNeutral and JPEG development, while preserving those RAW codes.
The manifest records exact file SHA-256, RAW-data identity, expected codes/RGB,
producer model/version/query count, clipping counts and bounded elapsed/heap
observations. Regeneration can change incidental measurement fields; image
samples/file hashes remain deterministic for the pinned engine/policy.

## Independent checks

The optional verifier uses Pillow's TIFF directory reader and independent strip
unpacking for exact RAW codes; Pillow decodes JPEG and standard EXIF. DOM/Expat
and lxml/libxml2 independently agree on XMP attributes. LibRaw's documented
opaque-handle C API opens, unpacks and renders every DNG, independently verifies
native dimensions/white code and reads camera-neutral WB gains. Its emitted
PPM is decoded by Pillow to verify all oriented output dimensions.

LibRaw API reference: https://www.libraw.org/docs/API-C.html. No LibRaw source,
private structure layout or version-dependent pointer offset is incorporated.
Its version is recorded in `independent-validation.json`. Different demosaic,
tone or display algorithms are not expected to produce pixel-identical images.

Standard capture metadata agree across DNG/JPEG; shared CaptureID/hash remain
separate from per-resource IDs and native RAW-data identity. Privacy checks
reject false camera/GPS/serial/host/creator/AI assertions through the existing
strict metadata contract and verify selected forbidden tags are absent in files.
Advanced noise hints, calibration matrices/signatures, rights fields and original
RAW-resource lineage are omitted when no justified mapping exists. See
[photographic export](PHOTOGRAPHIC_EXPORT.md) and
[capture metadata](CAPTURE_EXPORT_METADATA.md) for the existing field contract.

## Supported sizes and memory semantics

All existing stage limits remain unchanged: the reference producer,
reconstruction and full-native export path permit at most **4,096 native sites**.
The structural attachment ceiling alone does not authorize image execution.
No 24/45/60 MP export, streaming or resampling is claimed. A tiny output crop
cannot evade full-native counting. See [RAW frame envelope](RAW_FRAME_ENVELOPE.md)
and its complete-edge regression tests.

The generator also records 24/45/60 MP unsupported-size preflight requests with
an empty site payload. They reject before any provider invocation or large image
allocation. These are measured rejections with deliberately unsupported/missing
coverage, not typical-resolution memory/performance benchmarks. Before/after
heap is not peak memory; measured timings are informational. The explicit
bounded support declaration satisfies #16's supported-limit option without
claiming high-resolution processing or silently raising safety budgets.

## Recorded owner external acceptance — 2026-10-02

[Reviewed PR #201](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/pull/201) records owner-supplied screenshots: Lightroom 9.6 (build 20260923-1659-a32d844) opens landscape DNG at 72×48, both portraits at 48×72 and inverted landscape at 72×48. Exposure +2.34 brightens the landscape; WB at 6500 K/Tint −78 visibly changes the midtone band. The manual-WB thumbnail uses As Shot and shows a distinct warm band; Adobe's displayed 50,000 K/Tint +28 is its interpretation of synthetic gains, not measured color-temperature accuracy. Photoshop 2026 and Chrome render the landscape JPEG at 72×48.

Independent automated decoding covers all five pairs. User-Mac file hashes and exact Photoshop/Chrome builds were not supplied/reverified; editor/browser screenshots cover the landscape JPEG, not every JPEG variant. These limits are preserved. The committed independent report and `external-review.template.json` describe the earlier automated-only checkpoint; template booleans are not new acceptance evidence. PR #201 merged as `8f5259c4d6b40746173d7842554d416f0138ee27` after owner review/DCO and merge authorization, closing #16. The release audit does not regenerate scientific fixtures, claim additional editor tests or install/buy commercial tooling.

For a future export/model change, rerun the independent reader and relevant Adobe/editor/browser checks against that exact candidate and record hashes/builds. Runtime arithmetic/export schemas remain unchanged in this release preparation.

# 1.5.0 release candidate

Review snapshot: 2026-10-05. This document records the 1.5.0 engine release candidate. It does not tag, publish or activate a downstream application.

**Proposed version:** `@photivra/engine@1.5.0`, with `ENGINE_API_VERSION = "1.5.0"`. The backward-compatible public `NativeRawInput.tileWidth` option warrants a minor release rather than describing the entire change as a patch-only fix. This is an engine release identity, not the separate application's public Beta label.

**Candidate metadata is aligned to 1.5.0 on the release branch.** Generated references, exact-candidate CI/package validation, final review and owner publication authorization remain gates below.

## Current integration and owner review — 2026-10-06

The owner substantively reviewed and approved PRs #230 and #232, certified DCO 1.1 for those contributions and authorized contributor sign-off and merge after remaining checks. #232 merged with authorized sign-off as `7106fb90d8351cb769c2c01b0f10ebf1a437aea8`; its reviewed head `0d414b3f942c65f42a1a86f26c073a83093cd004` passed exact-head CI. The 1.5.0 candidate includes that bounded qualification checkpoint and preserves the reviewed #230 release changes at `7f33e4e39f94893ee93f87d90e7153d80ebd6f08`.

The checkpoint adds independent SI photon/electron tests and complete 2×2 resource pilots, not complete native Focus qualification or a public experimental API. #224 remains open. Historical draft/input-review statements below describe the October 5 preparation snapshot; they do not reopen completed contribution review/DCO. Generated API references were regenerated on the combined candidate with no file drift. Combined-candidate local validation passed: 2,184 tests / one existing skip, existing coverage thresholds, build, docs, packed consumers, package surface and configured image-formation benchmark. The actual 1.5.0 archive was inspected: 867 entries, root-only export, matching emitted version declarations and no repository-only API implementation/test/source/script/workflow tree. Final combined-candidate GitHub CI remains required before merge; publication remains separately authorized.

## Published baseline and exact candidate inputs

- Published GitHub release: [v1.4.0](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/releases/tag/v1.4.0), published on 2026-10-04.
- At this review, `main` and `v1.4.0` both identify commit `240340ec9e23ef79b6a0d729f494b2a531dd6df4`; their comparison contains no new commits or changed files.
- [PR #223](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/pull/223), head `04baece1a8d1a133db3e7a2f0c9daa0d662bb826`: optional native RAW execution chunks and preservation of the exact acquisition plan during same-RAW development.
- [PR #225](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/pull/225), head `70f55f5e27795d2fa51d112fbee1b14ee097b6ce`: experimental separable ideal-emission work, stacked on #223.
- This preparation branch starts at the #225 snapshot so neither draft is silently omitted from the review. That ancestry is not approval to ship either change. Reconcile this document whenever a source PR changes, is excluded, or is rebased.

The v1.4.0 GitHub release is verified here. A fresh direct npm-registry check was unavailable in this review; do not infer current registry dist-tags or integrity values from the GitHub release alone.

## Proposed release notes, subject to the gates below

### Bounded native RAW execution and development

Add an explicit integer `NativeRawInput.tileWidth` from 1 through 256 native sites. Omission preserves the existing 256-site execution and the original plan shape. The option controls provider request width, tile count and host-yield frequency; it is not a physical sampling or quality control.

Preserve that acquisition width when validating and developing an owned native RAW result. Reject invalid widths, inconsistent tile counts and stale plans rather than silently reconstructing the default-width plan. Existing CFA coordinates, absolute-index noise seeds, shutter timing and RAW/developed values remain the intended invariant.

The existing 100,000 logical-query tile bound, two-billion arbitrary-provider event bound and native raster/output-byte limits remain in force. Smaller chunks can solve a tile-admission problem; they do not solve an over-budget whole event or establish optical convergence.

### Experimental source work is not a supported release feature

#225 explores an explicit uniform-spectrum, achromatic ideal-emission factorization with separately counted geometry evaluations and spectral compositions. It does not establish that an external source satisfies separability, that a full native fixture is qualified, or that a device meets time/memory requirements. See [the draft contract](SEPARABLE_EMISSION_DRAFT.md).

Do not advertise or expose this as a supported public API. At the current #225 head the prototype lives under `src/api/`, which is built for repository checks but excluded by the npm package manifest and unreachable from the root browser/package graph. Promotion out of that repository-only boundary would be a separate reviewed public-contract change. A successful test suite alone remains insufficient for scientific or production qualification.

## Blocking findings

### Resolved prerequisite: experimental distribution boundary

#225 now restores the published `src/capture/native-environment-raw.ts` implementation unchanged and moves the separable-emission prototype under `src/api/`. The repository's existing package-surface check excludes `dist/api/`, and the browser/root reachability check does not traverse the prototype. The 128-ray correctness regression also carries an explicit 15-second test budget so Node 24 timing variance is not misreported as a scientific failure.

This boundary must remain verified on the final candidate. Moving the prototype into a published module or root dependency graph would reopen the release blocker.

### 1. Scientific/source and resource qualification remain unresolved

[Issue #224](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/issues/224) requires bounded full-event evidence and no hidden source assumption or raised safety ceiling. #225 proposes a distinct, four-billion scalar spectral-composition ceiling while preserving the two-billion legacy provider ceiling. Review whether this new source/work domain satisfies the approved scope; do not treat preserving the old ceiling as automatic approval of the new one.

Full-native depth/visibility/refinement results, independently checked output and measured resource evidence remain prerequisites for any newly claimed full-native capability. Keep source separability and transport unverified until evidence establishes them. Excluding the prototype from this release is valid; silently presenting partial-tile or synthetic controls as full-event qualification is not.

### 2. Substantive human review and contribution-specific DCO

The input PRs #223/#225/#226 received substantive human review and DCO approval before candidate preparation. The owner subsequently reviewed and certified #230/#232 on 2026-10-06, as recorded above. Follow [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md); use the authorized contributor sign-off for inclusion. This review does not establish the unresolved full-native/source/resource qualification under #224 or authorize public promotion of the experimental API.

## Validation already available for the code snapshots

- #223 records 2,151 passing tests and one existing skip at `04baece`, with CI [37216829043](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/actions/runs/37216829043).
- #225's corrected package-isolated head `70f55f5` passed CI [37384286949](https://github.com/Photivra/photivra/actions/runs/37384286949). The prior Node 24 timeout was addressed by an explicit correctness-test budget rather than changing scientific assertions or resource limits.
- The test counts above are taken from the source PR records, not a new local test execution. The inspected CI job outcomes establish those jobs' success, not review approval or scientific qualification.
- Neither snapshot is the final version-bumped release candidate. These results must not be reported as final 1.5.0 release verification. This preparation branch must rerun the matrix after every stacked-base or release-document change.

## Remaining release checklist

- [x] Isolate the experimental implementation from the published package/root dependency graph; keep package/browser-surface checks green on the final candidate.
- [x] Keep #225 experimental source/work-budget behavior repository-only and outside the public 1.5.0 package/API; #224 retains scientific qualification ownership.
- [x] #223/#225/#226 inclusion, substantive human review and DCO are recorded complete on engine main before this candidate branch; release-candidate changes still require final owner review.
- [x] Reconcile included stacked PRs in dependency order on engine main; retain any branches still needed by open work.
- [x] Set `package.json`, both root version fields in `package-lock.json`, `src/core/version.ts` and `CITATION.cff` to 1.5.0. No citation release date is asserted before publication.
- [x] Add the 1.5.0 changelog/release-context entry while preserving historical release records and independently versioned POC/schema/model identities.
- [x] Regenerate API documentation/`docs/api/exports.json` on the combined candidate; no generated drift.
- [x] Run local checks/coverage/build/docs/packed consumers/package gate/image-formation benchmark on the combined candidate and inspect the actual npm tarball and emitted root/declaration import graph. Final remote CI and final-main CI remain separate gates.
- [x] Owner scientific/source review and contribution-specific DCO certification cover the included contributions; final integration diff preserves the approved scope.
- [ ] Require green final-candidate CI before the signed merge and verify final-main CI before separate publication authorization.
- [ ] Verify protected main/tag configuration and trusted publishing, confirm the next npm version is absent, then authorize the separate tag/publish step. Never move v1.4.0 or attempt to overwrite its package.
- [ ] After publication, independently verify the npm version, dist-tag, tarball integrity and provenance, and publish matching GitHub release notes. Downstream dependency adoption and application qualification remain separate.

## Candidate preparation and verification

After resolving the inclusion/review decisions, use a clean checkout of the approved candidate. The existing release contract remains authoritative for guarded owner publication; see [release procedure](RELEASE_1_0_1.md#owner-release-procedure). The commands below perform preparation and checks only, not a tag or publication:

```sh
npm version 1.5.0 --no-git-tag-version --ignore-scripts
# Align src/core/version.ts and CITATION.cff, finalize CHANGELOG.md and
# current release-context prose; do not rewrite historical evidence.
npm ci --ignore-scripts
node scripts/generate-api-reference.mjs
node --test .github/test-node-lts-policy.mjs
node .github/node-lts-policy.mjs
npm run check
npm run coverage
npm run build
npm run docs:check
npm run release:consumer-check
npm run pack:check
npm run bench:image-formation:built
npm pack --ignore-scripts --json
```

Inspect the resulting tarball, its emitted declarations/imports and its recorded hashes. Keep temporary archives/build evidence untracked unless an existing evidence policy explicitly requires them. Review current [Node support](../NODE_SUPPORT.md); do not reuse a dated runtime snapshot as proof of future support. Any source, version, documentation, exclusion or generated-file change requires checks against that changed candidate.

**Stop before tagging or publishing until exact-candidate CI/package/tarball verification and owner authorization are complete.** No release tag, npm publication, GitHub release, application dependency change, automation or safety-cap change is performed by this preparation.

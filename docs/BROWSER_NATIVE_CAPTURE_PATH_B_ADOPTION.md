# Browser-Native Capture Path-B Adoption and Version Gate

Status: **frozen numerical-method adoption contract for Photivra engine issue #233**.

This document defines the final #233 governance boundary between:

- **Path A** — implementation optimization of the already approved discrete
  scientific calculation; and
- **Path B** — a different numerical method for approximating/evaluating the same
  supported physical quantity.

It complements:

- [Browser-First Dense-Pupil Native Capture Qualification Envelope](BROWSER_NATIVE_CAPTURE_ENVELOPE.md);
- [Browser-Native Capture Numerical Acceptance and Evidence Matrix](BROWSER_NATIVE_CAPTURE_NUMERICAL_ACCEPTANCE.md);
- [Browser-Native Capture Prepared-State, Ownership, and Invalidation Contract](BROWSER_NATIVE_CAPTURE_PREPARED_STATE.md);
- [Browser-Native Capture Robust Geometry and Precision Fallback Contract](BROWSER_NATIVE_CAPTURE_ROBUST_GEOMETRY.md);
- [Browser-Native Capture Whole-Event, Batch, Memory, and Failure Accounting Contract](BROWSER_NATIVE_CAPTURE_RESOURCE_ACCOUNTING.md);
- [Public API Style](API_STYLE.md);
- [Numerical Correctness and Physical Units](NUMERICAL_CORRECTNESS.md).

This is a **governing method/version contract**. It does not select a Path-B
algorithm, activate #236, change the current scientific calculation, change a
public API, bump a version, or establish that any alternative method is accurate.

## Core rule

A change remains **Path A** only when it preserves the same authoritative
discrete mathematical problem.

A change is **Path B** when it changes the numerical problem, estimator, sampling
measure, coverage/filtering semantics, or reproducibility/exactness contract.

Performance motivation does not decide the lane.

Mathematical and scientific semantics decide the lane.

## Path A identity

The currently approved Path-A calculation is defined by the existing committed:

- native site identities;
- spatial quadrature/sample identities and weights;
- shutter/temporal sample identities and weights;
- pupil sample identities and weights;
- wavelength sample identities and wavelength measures;
- source/camera/stage ordering;
- exact CFA/native-site/shutter/seed identities;
- deterministic sensor/noise/ADC ordering;
- required exact RAW/code behavior;
- numerical acceptance matrix;
- resource/admission contract.

Path-A implementation may change **how** that calculation is executed.

It may not silently change **what** is being calculated.

## Path-A-safe optimization examples

A change may remain Path A when the implementation can prove it evaluates the
same committed discrete calculation and preserves every applicable exact/tolerance
contract.

Examples include:

- validating/copying immutable source state once instead of once per sample;
- compact prepared source representations;
- eliminating repeated canonicalization or cloning;
- replacing object-heavy loops with typed-array/batched execution;
- CPU worker execution;
- WebAssembly `f64` execution that passes the same evidence;
- qualified lower-precision backend execution with the frozen fallback rules;
- deterministic loop reordering that preserves required output semantics;
- precomputing a coefficient that is invariant across every use consuming it;
- exact reuse of one wavelength-independent geometry result for two wavelength
  nodes of the **same exact geometric ray/time request**;
- algebraically factoring a term out of the current finite sum when exact
  applicability/invariance is proven;
- analytically simplifying an expression that is mathematically identical to the
  current committed discrete value and does not replace or remove any committed
  sampling measure.

A Path-A optimization may reduce **executed** operations.

It does not remove the logical support recorded by the resource-accounting
contract.

## The exact-factorization boundary

Exact factorization is Path A only when it is a refactoring of the same finite
discrete sum.

For a conceptual committed sum

`S = Σ_i Σ_j w_i v_j f(i,j)`,

a transformation may stay Path A when it is proven that, over the declared
supported domain, the same represented quantity is obtained by an algebraically
equivalent evaluation such as reusing a term that is invariant in `j`.

The following do **not** become Path A merely because they are called
“factorization”:

- replacing sampled values with an analytical integral over a dimension;
- dropping committed nodes because a smoothness assumption suggests they are
  redundant;
- averaging source state before local applicability checks;
- changing sample locations or weights;
- interpolating/extrapolating between committed nodes to avoid evaluating them;
- replacing point-sample visibility with filtered/rasterized coverage;
- estimating the sum from a subset of nodes;
- introducing a stochastic estimator for the same integral.

Those are Path B unless an independent proof shows the transformation is exactly
the same committed finite calculation for the entire supported domain.

## Mandatory Path-B triggers

A proposal enters Path-B review if it changes any of the following.

### Sampling support

- number of committed spatial, temporal, pupil, or wavelength samples;
- sample coordinates;
- sample sequence;
- sample pairing/correlation structure;
- quadrature partition;
- wavelength measure;
- source coverage/support.

### Weights or normalization

- quadrature weights;
- pupil weighting;
- temporal weighting;
- spectral measure;
- normalization;
- filtering/coverage kernel;
- estimator weighting.

### Estimator semantics

- replacing the committed finite sum with analytical integration;
- Monte Carlo or quasi-Monte Carlo estimation;
- randomized low-discrepancy sequences;
- stratified/joint sampling that changes the existing sample set;
- deterministic adaptive quadrature;
- data-dependent sample placement;
- control variates;
- importance sampling;
- surrogate/model-based estimation;
- learned approximation.

### Stopping/adaptation

- convergence-driven stopping;
- error-estimate-driven stopping;
- adaptive refinement;
- early termination based on scene/output values;
- device-dependent sample reduction;
- sample-budget selection that changes authoritative output semantics.

### Visibility/coverage semantics

- rasterized coverage replacing exact aperture-origin ray visibility;
- conservative/filtered visibility that changes the sampled quantity;
- coverage masks that replace the current point/ray sample semantics.

### Reproducibility/exactness

- changing deterministic seed schedules;
- adding numerical-method seeds/scrambles;
- changing the reduction contract so existing required exact RAW/code identities
  no longer hold;
- changing which outputs are exact versus tolerance/statistical classes.

### Physical quantity or stage meaning

Any proposal that changes the physical model, source quantity, optics/sensor stage
meaning, coordinate convention, or applicability domain is **more than a Path-B
numerical-method change** and requires the owning scientific/model governance too.

Path B is not permission to change physics.

## Changes that are not Path-B triggers by themselves

These changes do not automatically enter Path B when every Path-A semantic
contract remains unchanged:

- batch/tile width;
- worker scheduling;
- data layout;
- cache eviction policy;
- CPU versus WebAssembly implementation;
- GPU versus CPU execution;
- acceleration structure choice;
- loop fusion/fission;
- deterministic parallelism;
- equivalent stable arithmetic reformulation;
- exact precomputation/reuse under the prepared-state contract;
- robust-geometry fallback that preserves the exact request and approved result
  semantics.

A backend change can still fail Path-A qualification if it changes numerical or
exact output behavior.

## #236 activation gate

Issue #236 is **conditional**, not mandatory release work.

It activates only when at least one documented trigger exists.

Acceptable triggers include:

1. **resource obstruction** — the approved Path-A calculation cannot satisfy the
   frozen whole-event/refinement resource contract after reasonable exact
   implementation optimization;
2. **accuracy obstruction** — a candidate implementation cannot satisfy the frozen
   numerical acceptance while retaining Path-A semantics;
3. **method proposal** — a candidate intentionally changes sampling, weighting,
   coverage/filtering, estimator, stopping, or reproducibility semantics;
4. **backend semantic mismatch** — a backend's useful execution model cannot be
   represented as the same committed Path-A calculation without changing its
   sample/coverage meaning.

A trigger record must cite reproducible evidence.

“Could be faster,” “looks equivalent,” or “common graphics practice” is not a
trigger by itself.

## When #236 is unnecessary

#236 may be explicitly deferred as unnecessary when Path A:

- preserves the approved science;
- satisfies all required BNCE exact/numerical evidence;
- admits the base event and required refinements within existing resource limits;
- satisfies browser/reference/fallback requirements; and
- is sufficiently useful for the approved customer/release envelope.

Deferring #236 because Path A succeeds is a valid disposition.

It is not an incomplete scientific gate.

## Required Path-B method contract

Before implementing a Path-B method for production evaluation, its decision record
must define the method independently of code.

At minimum it must include:

- method name and method-contract version;
- physical quantity being approximated;
- explicit mathematical integral/sum/estimator;
- units;
- source/camera/stage scope;
- supported source assumptions;
- sample domain;
- node/sequence generation;
- weights/normalization;
- seed/scramble identity where applicable;
- adaptation/stopping rule;
- maximum work;
- nonconvergence behavior;
- expected bias/consistency properties;
- error/uncertainty estimator semantics if any;
- reproducibility guarantees;
- relationship to physical sensor-noise seeds;
- fallback/unsupported behavior.

No production implementation should define these semantics accidentally through
code.

## Deterministic Path-B methods

An analytical or deterministic adaptive method still requires Path-B governance
when it changes the committed Path-A numerical problem.

Its evidence must address:

- deterministic bias/error;
- applicability;
- discontinuities and visibility boundaries;
- refinement/convergence behavior where applicable;
- repeatability;
- full-native resource behavior.

“Analytical” does not automatically mean exact over the supported source domain.

## Stochastic Path-B methods

A stochastic or randomized quasi-Monte-Carlo method requires additional identity.

At minimum freeze:

- numerical integration seed;
- scramble/sequence algorithm;
- sequence version;
- sample index mapping;
- whether samples are shared/correlated across sites, wavelengths, frames, or
  paired captures;
- stopping rule;
- maximum samples;
- nonconvergence outcome.

The numerical-method seed is distinct from the physical sensor-noise seed.

Integration randomness must not become simulated shot/read noise.

Changing scheduling/device/batch order must not silently change the declared
integration sequence unless the method contract explicitly makes that change part
of its versioned semantics.

## Error evidence

Path B does not inherit Path-A exactness merely because it targets the same
physical quantity.

The method proposal must predeclare which outputs are evaluated by:

- exact identity;
- deterministic numerical tolerance;
- convergence/refinement;
- statistical confidence/coverage;
- fail-closed behavior.

For stochastic methods, evidence must include multiple independent
seed/scramble realizations where needed to assess variance/bias.

An estimated standard error is not a rigorous bound unless the method and claim
justify that interpretation.

A visually clean image is never numerical qualification evidence.

## Difficult cases

Path-B qualification must include the difficult cases already frozen by #224,
including where applicable:

- aperture-visible slivers;
- translated/subpixel geometry;
- grazing/near-coincident visibility;
- shifted sample phases;
- focus/aperture changes;
- shutter boundaries;
- spectral structure;
- sensor clipping/full-well/ADC thresholds;
- cancellation/resource limits.

A method that performs well only for smooth scenes is not qualified for a
discontinuous-visibility claim.

## Physical sensor noise separation

Qualify Path-B noise-free expected photons/electrons first.

Only after that passes may the existing sensor-noise/ADC stages be applied.

Do not:

- fold integration variance into shot noise;
- denoise an authoritative result to hide integration error;
- tune a numerical integration seed to match expected RAW noise;
- reuse physical-noise randomness as the numerical estimator seed.

For paired A/B captures, Compare, or regression evidence, document whether
integration randomness is paired, independent, or deterministic and why.

## Exact RAW implications

A Path-B method is not automatically required to reproduce every Path-A
intermediate floating-point value.

However, if the product/public contract claims compatibility with an existing
authoritative deterministic RAW output, then the existing exact RAW/code
requirements remain binding.

If a valid alternative numerical method changes authoritative output bytes/codes
under the same declared request, that is a semantic/versioning change.

Do not retrospectively loosen Path-A RAW acceptance to make Path B appear
compatible.

## Resource contract

Any Path-B method must obey the same no-loophole resource governance:

- complete whole-event admission;
- bounded batches;
- bounded memory;
- attempted-work accounting;
- failure/cancellation accounting;
- no split-event budget reset;
- no weaker-device silent scientific downgrade.

Path B does not inherit the rejected four-billion spectral ceiling.

If Path B needs a new resource ceiling, that policy change requires separate
review and cannot be smuggled into the method adoption.

## Version identity

Every Path-B method considered for adoption must have an explicit independent
method/integrator contract version.

The method version must change when any semantic element changes, including:

- sample/sequence generation;
- weights;
- normalization;
- estimator equation;
- stopping/adaptation;
- seed/scramble semantics;
- convergence/nonconvergence behavior;
- supported domain;
- output exactness/reproducibility promise.

Pure implementation optimizations under an unchanged method contract do not
require a method-version change.

## Package/API/SemVer gate

A method-version change and an npm/package version change are distinct decisions.

Before adoption, classify observable impact.

### Internal-only experimental evaluation

A repository-only experiment may use its own explicit method version without
changing the root package API when:

- it is not reachable from the published root/package;
- no public serialized contract changes;
- no existing public request changes meaning;
- no published output guarantee changes.

This is the preferred first evaluation lane for #236.

### Additive public method

Exposing an explicitly opt-in new public method may be additive if:

- existing request semantics and defaults remain unchanged;
- existing serialized data continues to mean the same thing;
- the new method has explicit identity/version fields;
- fallback/default behavior does not silently select it.

The package still receives the normal release version for the release containing
the feature.

### Existing public behavior changes

If the same existing public request begins using a different numerical method and
that change can alter scientific/output semantics, reproducibility, exact RAW, or
serialized meaning, it is a public semantic change.

It requires:

- explicit compatibility review;
- relevant schema/contract version change;
- changelog/migration documentation;
- package SemVer treatment consistent with [API_STYLE.md](API_STYLE.md).

After package 1.0, a breaking root-public-contract change requires the normal
major-version process.

Do not label a scientifically meaningful behavior change “internal” solely
because TypeScript signatures are unchanged.

## Default-selection gate

A Path-B method may not become the default merely because it passes isolated tests
or benchmarks.

Default adoption requires:

- complete method-specific qualification;
- full supported base/refinement evidence;
- measured resource behavior;
- compatibility/version review;
- downstream/source/device implications understood;
- explicit owner scientific/product approval.

Until then, experimental evaluation remains opt-in/repository-only or absent.

## Migration requirements

When adoption changes observable behavior, document:

- old method identity;
- new method identity;
- old versus new supported domains;
- expected numerical/output differences;
- deterministic/stochastic reproducibility differences;
- seed migration;
- serialized capture/plan compatibility;
- fallback behavior;
- whether old behavior remains selectable;
- downstream requalification required.

Historical evidence remains bound to the method/version that produced it.

Do not reinterpret old evidence as evidence for a new method.

## Scientific approval gate

No Path-B method becomes production-authoritative without explicit
method-specific scientific approval after its evidence is available.

Approval of this governance document is **not** approval of any future method.

Approval must identify:

- method/version;
- supported envelope;
- evidence record;
- known limitations;
- compatibility/version disposition.

Contribution-specific DCO/review remains required for the actual implementation
contribution.

## Stable Path-B evidence IDs

The following stable evidence labels refine BNCE-PATHB-001.

| Evidence ID | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **BNCE-PATHB-001-A** | Trigger record identifies why Path B is being evaluated or explicitly records that it is unnecessary. |
| **BNCE-PATHB-001-B** | Method equation/estimator, support, weights, normalization, and method version are frozen before production implementation. |
| **BNCE-PATHB-001-C** | Seed/scramble/stopping/nonconvergence identity is frozen for stochastic/adaptive methods. |
| **BNCE-PATHB-001-D** | Independent analytical/reference and difficult-case evidence is predeclared and executed. |
| **BNCE-PATHB-001-E** | Numerical/integration uncertainty remains separate from source/calibration and physical sensor noise. |
| **BNCE-PATHB-001-F** | Full-native base/refinement work, memory, cancellation and failure behavior satisfies the approved resource contract. |
| **BNCE-PATHB-001-G** | Exact/tolerance/statistical output classes and any RAW compatibility consequences are explicit. |
| **BNCE-PATHB-001-H** | API/schema/method/package version and migration disposition is documented. |
| **BNCE-PATHB-001-I** | Method is explicitly selected, rejected, or deferred as unnecessary; no silent adoption. |
| **BNCE-PATHB-001-J** | Production/default adoption has method-specific scientific approval and contribution-specific review/DCO. |

These evidence IDs are governance labels, not public API identifiers.

## Decision outcomes

A Path-B study must end in one explicit disposition.

### Selected

The method meets its declared evidence and is approved for a named supported
scope/version.

Selection does not automatically make it public or default.

### Rejected

The method does not meet scientific, resource, compatibility, or customer
requirements.

Record why.

Do not weaken acceptance criteria to avoid rejection.

### Deferred as unnecessary

Path A satisfies #224 and no changed numerical method is needed.

Record the evidence supporting that conclusion.

This disposition allows #236 to remain unimplemented.

## Relationship to #234 and #235

The #234 float64 reference is Path A.

#234 must not introduce a changed quadrature/estimator to solve resource pressure.

If implementation profiling uncovers a genuine Path-A obstruction, record it as a
possible #236 trigger rather than silently changing the method.

#235 candidate browser backends are also Path A only when they preserve the same
committed numerical semantics.

A backend that needs different coverage/filtering/sample semantics enters Path B
before adoption.

## Acceptance for this #233 final governing slice

This governing slice is complete when reviewed and merged with:

- [x] exact Path-A versus Path-B boundary;
- [x] explicit mandatory Path-B triggers;
- [x] exact-factorization boundary;
- [x] conditional #236 activation and valid “unnecessary” disposition;
- [x] required method equation/applicability/seed/stopping contract;
- [x] deterministic and stochastic evidence rules;
- [x] sensor-noise separation;
- [x] exact RAW/version implications;
- [x] resource-policy preservation;
- [x] independent method-version identity;
- [x] package/API/SemVer classification gate;
- [x] migration/default-selection gates;
- [x] explicit method-specific scientific approval;
- [x] BNCE-PATHB-001-A…J evidence labels;
- [x] selected/rejected/deferred decision outcomes.

This checklist freezes governance only.

After this slice, #233 requires one final reconciliation pass to confirm that the
merged source/camera, numerical, prepared-state, robust-geometry, resource, and
Path-B contracts are internally consistent and sufficient to hand #234 an
implementation target without inventing scientific policy in code.

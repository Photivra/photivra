 * Host side of the display view's Quality path on the GPU (#479): the support check, the float64 tables (the lattice groups
 * and their combined diffraction kernels per material and channel, as the reference forms them; the bilinear and AHD
 * candidate kernels; the footprint geometry), the three passes per band of display rows (lattice materials, site moments,
 * display pixels; `wgsl-display-view-quality-kernel.ts`), the low-signal correction states (computed on the host with the
 * reference's own `computeDisplayViewCorrectionStates`, #447, uploaded as a sorted table and grown from the grid keys the
 * kernel records), and the reference's own float64 finishing per display pixel (`finishDisplayViewPixel` of the Speed host:
 * the quantization term, the seeded noise draw, the Cholesky factor, the clipped centre, the sRGB encode and the rounding),
 * so the noise draw is bit-identical to the CPU's.
 *
 * Defocus (#492 step 2c): out of focus the expected signal carries the defocus disc (or each node's diffraction kernel
 * convolved with it) as site kernels, up to radius 96. The site pass then reads a factored table, sums in blocks, and reads a
 * lattice whose uncertain points the host resolved with the reference's own material lookup; a band's site pass is split over
 * dispatches of at most `DISPLAY_VIEW_QUALITY_SITE_TAPS_PER_DISPATCH` taps. A defocused Speed request runs these passes with
 * its bilinear demosaic (docs/WEBGPU.md, "Defocus on the GPU").
 *
 * The float64 reference is `renderDisplayView` (facade/display-view.ts) on the exact-area-mean path with
 * `createDisplayViewExpectedSignal` (facade/expected-signal.ts), chart materials, with or without diffraction kernels,
 * the bilinear or the AHD candidates and the low-signal correction. Internal: not exported from the package.
 *
 * Flagged display pixels (an uncertain lattice material among the sites read, a missing correction state after the
 * states were computed, a correction-threshold decision within its bound, a non-finite output) are recomputed with the
 * reference, so they are exact. Every stage's wall-clock time is reported (`stageMilliseconds`); on a software adapter it
 * is not GPU performance.

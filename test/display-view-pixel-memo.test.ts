 * #392: the per-real-pixel memo replays a sample's recorded terms when another sample of the same display pixel lands on the
 * same real pixel. Views barely smaller than the frame put most of a display pixel's samples on a few real pixels. Their
 * hashes were recorded before the memo on 2.6.0 (abb8b27), where the memo changed no byte; since #393 these views take the
 * exact area mean (each footprint at most 25 real pixels), and the hashes were re-recorded with that deliberate reference change.

// Usage: node scripts/check-scancode-policy.mjs <scancode.json>
//
// The report must come from ScanCode Toolkit 32.5.0 run with --license and
// --copyright (see docs/DEVELOPERS.md, "Licence and copyright scan"). Policy:
//
// - every detected licence (detections and low-confidence clues) must be
//   Apache-2.0;
// - every copyright holder must be William Shackelford or Photivra
//   contributors;
// - no file may have a scan error.
//
// Anything else fails unless the exact file and finding are on the allowlists
// below. An entry names one file and one licence expression (or one holder),
// so a new licence or holder in an allowlisted file still fails. Every entry
// gives its reason. Adding or widening an entry needs the owner's review in the
// pull request. An entry whose file is scanned but no longer has that finding
// also fails, so the lists stay current.
